'Snape reckons I can carry on by myself now I've got the basics.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So you've stopped having funny dreams?' said Hermione sceptically.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Pretty much,' said Harry, not looking at her.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, I don't think Snape should stop until you're absolutely sure you can control them!' said Hermione indignantly. 'Harry, I think you should go back to him and ask - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' said Harry forcefully. 'Just drop it, Hermione, OK?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was the first day of the Easter holidays and Hermione, as was her custom, had spent a large part of the day drawing up revision timetables for the three of them. Harry and Ron had let her do it; ii. was easier than arguing with her and, in any case, they might come in useful.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron had been startled to discover there were only six weeks left until their exams.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'How can that come as a shock?' Hermione demanded, as she tapped each little square on Ron's timetable with her wand so that il flashed a different colour according to its subject.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I dunno,' said Ron, 'there's been a lot going on.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, there you are,' she said, handing him his timetable, 'if you follow that you should do fine.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron looked down it gloomily, but then brightened.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You've given me an evening off every week!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'That's for Quidditch practice,' said Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The smile faded from Ron's face.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What's the point?' he said dully. 'We've got about as much chance of winning the Quidditch Cup this year as Dad's got of becoming Minister for Magic.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione said nothing; she was looking at Harry, who was staring blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while Crookshanks pawed at his hand, trying to get his ears scratched.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What's wrong, Harry?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What?' he said quickly. 'Nothing.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He seized his copy of Defensive Magical Theory and pretended to be looking something up in the index. Crookshanks gave him up as a bad job and slunk away under Hermione's chair.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I saw Cho earlier,' said Hermione tentatively. 'She looked really miserable, too . . . have you two had a row again?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Wha- oh, yeah, we have,' said Harry, seizing gratefully on the excuse.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What about?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 That sneak friend of hers, Marietta,' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah, well, I don't blame you!' said Ron angrily, setting down his revision timetable. 'If it hadn't been for her . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron went into a rant about Marietta Edgecombe, which Harry found helpful; all he had to do was look angry, nod and say 'Yeah' and That's right' whenever Ron drew breath, leaving his mind free to dwell, ever more miserably, on what he had seen in the Pensieve.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He felt as though the memory of it was eating him from inside. He had been so sure his parents were wonderful people that he had never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving the aspersions Snape cast on his father's character. Hadn't people like Hagrid and Sirius told Harry how wonderful his father had been? (Yeah, well, look what Sirius was like himself, said a nagging voice inside Harry's head . . . he was as bad, wasn't he?) Yes, he had once overheard Professor McGonagall saying that his father and Sirius had been troublemakers at school, but she had described them as forerunners of the Weasley twins, and Harry could not imagine Fred and George dangling someone upside-down for the fun of it . . . not unless they really loathed them . . . perhaps Malfoy or somebody who really deserved it .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had suffered at James's hands: but hadn't Lily asked, 'What's he done to you?' And hadn't James replied, 'It's more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean.' Hadn't James started it all simply because Sirius had said he was bored? Harry remembered Lupin saying back in Grimmauld Place that Dumbledore had made him prefect in the hope that he would be able to exercise some control over James and Sirius . . . but in the Pensieve, he had sat there and let it all happen . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry kept reminding himself that Lily had intervened; his mother had been decent. Yet, the memory of the look on her face as she had shouted at James disturbed him quite as much as anything else; she had clearly loathed James, and Harry simply could not understand how they could have ended up married. Once or twice he even wondered whether James had forced her into it . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 For nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of comfort, of inspiration. Whenever someone had told him he was like James, he had glowed with pride inside. And now . . . now he felt cold and miserable at the thought of him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The weather grew breezier, brighter and warmer as the Easter holidays passed, but Harry, along with the rest of the fifth- and seventh-years, was trapped inside, revising, traipsing back and forth to the library. Harry pretended his bad mood had no other cause but the approaching exams, and as his fellow Gryffindors were sick of studying themselves, his excuse went unchallenged.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry, I'm talking to you, can you hear me?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Huh?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He looked round. Ginny Weasley, looking very windswept, had joined him at the library table where he had been sitting alone. It was late on Sunday evening: Hermione had gone back to Gryffindor Tower to revise Ancient Runes, and Ron had Quidditch practice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, hi,' said Harry, pulling his books towards him. 'How come you're not at practice?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's over,' said Ginny. 'Ron had to take Jack Sloper up to the hospital wing.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Why?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, we're not sure, but we think he knocked himself out with\\u00a0 \\u00a0 his own bat.' She sighed heavily. 'Anyway . . . a package just arrived, it's only just got through Umbridge's new screening process.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper on to the table; it had clearly been unwrapped and carelessly re-wrapped. There was a scribbled note across it in red ink, reading: Inspected and Passed by the Hogwarts High Inquisitor.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's Easter eggs from Mum,' said Ginny. There's one for you . . . there you go.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She handed him a handsome chocolate egg decorated with small, iced Snitches and, according to the packaging, containing a bag of Fizzing Whizzbees. Harry looked at it for a moment, then, to his horror, felt a lump rise in his throat.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Are you OK, Harry?' Ginny asked quietly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah, I'm fine,' said Harry gruffly. The lump in his throat was painful. He did not understand why an Easter egg should have made him feel like this.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You seem really down lately,' Ginny persisted. 'You know, I'm sure if you just talked to Cho . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's not Cho I want to talk to,' said Harry brusquely.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Who is it, then?' asked Ginny, watching him closely.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He glanced around to make quite sure nobody was listening. Madam Pince was several shelves away, stamping out a pile cf books for a frantic-looking Hannah Abbott.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I wish I could talk to Sirius,' he muttered. 'But I know I can't.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ginny continued to watch him thoughtfully. More to give himself something to do than because he really wanted any, Harry unwrapped his Easter egg, broke off a large bit and put it into his mouth.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well,' said Ginny slowly, helping herself to a bit of egg, too, 'if you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect we could think of a way to do it.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Come on,' said Harry dully. 'With Umbridge policing the fires and reading all our mail?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The thing about growing up with Fred and George,' said Ginny thoughtfully, 'is that you sort of start thinking anything's possible if you've got enough nerve.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry looked at her. Perhaps it was the effect of the chocolate - '- Lupin had always advised eating some after encounters with Dementors - or simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had been burning inside him for a week, but he felt a bit more hopeful.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh damn,' whispered Ginny, jumping to her feet. 'I forgot - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Madam Pince was swooping down on them, her shrivelled face contorted with rage.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Chocolate in the library!' she screamed. 'Out - out - OUT!' And whipping out her wand, she caused Harry's books, bag and ink bottle to chase him and Ginny from the library, whacking them repeatedly over the head as they ran.*As though to underline the importance of their upcoming examinations, a batch of pamphlets, leaflets and notices concerning various wizarding careers appeared on the tables in Gryffindor Tower shortly before the end of the holidays, along with yet another notice on the board, which read:CAREERS ADVICEAll fifth-years are required to attend a short meeting with theirHead of House during the first week of the summer term to discusstheir future careers. Times of individual appointments are listed below.Harry looked down the list and found that he was expected in Professor McGonagall's office at half past two on Monday, which would mean missing most of Divination. He and the other fifth-years spent a considerable part of the final weekend of the Easter break reading all the careers information that had been left there for their perusal.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, I don't fancy Healing,' said Ron on the last evening of the holidays. He was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed bone-and-wand emblem of St Mungo's on its front. 'It says here you need at least \\\\E\\\\\\\" at NEWT level in Potions, Herbology, Transfiguration, Charms and Defence Against the Dark Arts. I mean . . . blimey . . . don't want much, do they?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, it's a very responsible job, isn't it?' said Hermione absently.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She was poring over a bright pink and orange leaflet, that was headed, 'SO YOU THINK YOU'D LIKE TO WORK IN MUGGLE RELATIONS?' 'You don't seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles; all they want is an OWL in Muggle Studies: Much more important is your enthusiasm, patience and a good sense of fun!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You'd need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,' said Harry darkly. 'Good sense of when to duck, more like.' He was halfway through a pamphlet on wizard banking. 'Listen to this: Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel, adventure and substantial, danger-related treasure bonuses? Then consider a position with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, who are currently recruiting Curse-Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad . . . They want Arithmancy, though; you could do it, Hermione!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I don't much fancy banking,' said Hermione vaguely, now immersed in: 'HAVE YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO TRAIN SECURITY TROLLS?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hey,' said a voice in Harry's ear. He looked round; Fred and George had come to join them. 'Ginny's had a word with us about you,' said Fred, stretching out his legs on the table in front of them and causing several booklets on careers with the Ministry of Magic to slide off on to the floor. 'She says you need to talk to Sirius?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What?' said Hermione sharply, freezing with her hand halfway towards picking up 'MAKE A BANG AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MAGICAL ACCIDENTS AND CATASTROPHES'.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah . . .' said Harry, trying to sound casual, 'yeah, I thought I'd like - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Don't be so ridiculous,' said Hermione, straightening up and looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes. 'With Umbridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, we think we can find a way around that,' said George, stretching and smiling. 'It's a simple matter of causing a diversion. Now, you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the mayhem front during the Easter holidays?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What was the point, we asked ourselves, of disrupting leisure time?' continued Fred. 'No point at all, we answered ourselves. And of course, we'd have messed up people's revision, too, which would be the very last thing we'd want to do.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He gave Hermione a sanctimonious little nod. She looked rather taken aback by this thoughtfulness.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'But it's business as usual from tomorrow,' Fred continued briskly. 'And if we're going to be causing a bit of uproar, why not do it so that Harry can have his chat with Sirius?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, but still,' said Hermione, with an air of explaining something very simple to somebody very obtuse, 'even if you do cause a diversion, how is Harry supposed to talk to him?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Umbridge's office,' said Harry quietly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could come up with no alternative. Umbridge herself had told him that the only fire that was not being watched was her own.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Are - you - insane?' said Hermione in a hushed voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron had lowered his leaflet on jobs in the Cultivated Fungus Trade and was watching the conversation warily.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I don't think so,' said Harry, shrugging.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And how are you going to get in there in the first place?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry was ready for this question.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Sirius's knife,' he said.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Excuse me?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Christmas before last Sirius gave me a knife that'll open any lock,' said Harry. 'So even if she's bewitched the door so Alahomora won't work, which I bet she has - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What do you think about this?' Hermione demanded of Ron, and Harry was reminded irresistibly of Mrs Weasley appealing to her husband during Harry's first dinner in Grimmauld Place.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I dunno,' said Ron, looking alarmed at being asked to give an opinion. 'If Harry wants to do it, it's up to him, isn't it?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Spoken like a true friend and Weasley,' said Fred, clapping Ron hard on the back. 'Right, then. We're thinking of doing it tomorrow, just after lessons, because it should cause maximum impact ii everybody's in the corridors - Harry, we'll set it off in the east wing somewhere, draw her right away from her own office - I reckon we should be able to guarantee you, what, twenty minutes?' he said, looking at George.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Easy,' said George.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What sort of diversion is it?' asked Ron.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You'll see, little bro', said Fred, as he and George got up again. 'At least, you will if you trot along to Gregory the Smarmy's corridor round about five o'clock tomorrow.'*Harry awoke very early the next day, feeling almost as anxious as he had done on the morning of his disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic. It was not only the prospect of breaking into Umbridge's office and using her fire to speak to Sirius that was making him feel nervous, though that was certainly bad enough; today also happened to be the first time Harry would be in close proximity to Snape since Snape had thrown him out of his office.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead, Harry got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside Neville's bed, and stared out on a truly glorious morning. The sky was a clear, misty, opalescent blue. Directly ahead of him, Harry could see the towering beech tree below which his father had once tormented Snape. He was not sure what Sirius could possibly say to him that would make up for what he had seen in the Pensieve, but he was desperate to hear Sirius's own account of what had happened, to know of any mitigating factors there might have been, any excuse at all for his fathers behaviour . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Something caught Harry's attention: movement on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. Harry squinted into the sun and saw Hagrid emerging from between the trees. He seemed to be limping. As Harry watched, Hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared inside it. Harry watched the cabin for several minutes. Hagrid did not emerge again, but smoke furled from the chimney, so Hagrid could not be so badly injured that he was unequal tc stoking the fire.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry turned away from the window, headed back to his trunk and started to dress.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 With the prospect of forcing entry into Umbridge's office ahead. Harry had never expected the day to be a restful one, but he had not reckoned on Hermione's almost continual attempts to dissuade him from what he was planning to do at five o'clock. For the first time ever, she was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in\\u00a0 \\u00a0 History of Magic as Harry and Ron were, keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that Harry tried very hard to ignore.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 '. . . and if she does catch you there, apart from being expelled, she'll be able to guess you've been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect she'll force you to drink Veritaserum and answer her questions . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hermione,' said Ron in a low and indignant voice, 'are you going to stop telling Harry off and listen to Binns, or am I going to have to take my own notes?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You take notes for a change, it won't kill you!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 By the time they reached the dungeons, neither Harry nor Ron was speaking to Hermione. Undeterred, she took advantage of their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow oi dire warnings, all uttered under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to waste five whole minutes checking his cauldron for leaks.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Snape, meanwhile, seemed to have decided to act as though Harry were invisible. Harry was, of course, well-used to this tactic, as it was one of Uncle Vernons favourites, and on the whole was grateful he had to suffer nothing worse. In fact, compared to what he usually had to endure from Snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks, he found the new approach something of an improvement, and was pleased to find that when left well alone, he was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite easily. At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask, corked it and took it up to Snape's desk for marking, feeling that he might at last have scraped an 'E'.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise. Malfoy gave a gleeful yell of laughter. Harry whipped around. His potion sample lay in pieces on the floor and Snape was surveying him with a look of gloating pleasure.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Whoops,' he said softly. 'Another zero, then, Potter.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry was too incensed to speak. He strode back to his cauldron, intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it, but saw to his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm sorry!' said Hermione, with her hands over her mouth. I'm really sorry, Harry. I thought you'd finished, so I cleared up!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry could not bring himself to answer. When the bell rang, he hurried out of the dungeon without a backwards glance, and made sure that he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so that Hermione could not start nagging him again about using Umbridge's office.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He was in such a bad mood by the time he got to Divination that he had quite forgotten his careers appointment with Professor McGonagall, remembering it only when Ron asked him why he wasn't in her office. He hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath, only a few minutes late.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Sorry, Professor,' he panted, as he closed the door. 'I forgot.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No matter, Potter,' she said briskly, but as she spoke, somebody else sniffed from the corner. Harry looked round.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor Umbridge was sitting there, a clipboard on her knee, a fussy little pie-frill around her neck and a small, horribly smug smile on her face.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Sit down, Potter,' said Professor McGonagall tersely. Her hands shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry sat down with his back to Umbridge and did his best to pretend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, Potter, this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have, and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into the sixth and seventh years,' said Professor McGonagall. 'Have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave Hogwarts?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er - ' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He was finding the scratching noise from behind him very distracting.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes?' Professor McGonagall prompted Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,' Harry mumbled.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You'd need top grades for that,' said Professor McGonagall, extracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it. They ask for a minimum of five NEWTs, and nothing under \\\\\\\"Exceeds Expectations\\\\\\\" grade, I see. Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office. It's a difficult career path, Potter, they only take the best. In fact, I don't think anybody has been taken on in the last three years.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 At this moment, Professor Umbridge gave a very tiny cough, as though she was trying to see how quietly she could do it. Professor McGonagall ignored her.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You'll want to know which subjects you ought to take, I suppose?' she went on, talking a little louder than before.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes,' said Harry. 'Defence Against the Dark Arts, I suppose?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Naturally,' said Professor McGonagall crisply. 'I would also advise -'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor Umbridge gave another cough, a little more audible this time. Professor McGonagall closed her eyes for a moment, opened them again, and continued as though nothing had happened.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my NEWT classes unless they have achieved \\\\\\\"Exceeds Expectations\\\\\\\" or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level. I'd say you're averaging \\\\\\\"Acceptable\\\\\\\" at the moment, so you'll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing. Then you ought to do Charms, always useful, and Potions. Yes, Potter, Potions,' she added, with the merest flicker of a smile. 'Poisons and antidotes are essential study for Aurors. And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to take students who get anything other than \\\\\\\"Outstanding\\\\\\\" in their OWLs, so - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor Umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'May I offer you a cough drop, Dolores?' Professor McGonagall asked curtly, without looking at Professor Umbridge.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, no, thank you very much,' said Umbridge, with that simpering laugh Harry hated so much. 'I just wondered whether I could make the teensiest interruption, Minerva?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I daresay you'll find you can,' said Professor McGonagall through tightly gritted teeth.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I was just wondering whether Mr Potter has quite the temperament for an Auror?' said Professor Umbridge sweetly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Were you?' said Professor McGonagall haughtily. 'Well, Potter,' she continued, as though there had been no interruption, if you are serious in this ambition, I would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch. I see Professor Flitwick has graded you between \\\\\\\"Acceptable\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Exceeds Expectations\\\\\\\" for the last two years, so your Charmwork seems satisfactory. As for Defence Against the Dark Arts, your marks have been generally high, Professor Lupin in particular thought you - are you quite sure you wouldn't like a cough drop, Dolores?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, no need, thank you, Minerva,' simpered Professor Umbridge, who had just coughed her loudest yet. 'I was just concerned that you might not have Harry's most recent Defence Against the Dark Arts marks in front of you. I'm quite sure I slipped in a note.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What, this thing?' said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revulsion, as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of Harry's folder. She glanced down it, her eyebrows slightly raised, then placed it back into the folder without comment.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, as I was saying, Potter, Professor Lupin thought you showed a pronounced aptitude for the subject, and obviously for an Auror - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Did you not understand my note, Minerva?' asked Professor Umbndge in honeyed tones, quite forgetting to cough.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Of course I understood it,' said Professor McGonagall, her teeth clenched so tightly the words came out a little muffled.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, then, I am confused . . . I'm afraid I don't quite understand how you can give Mr Potter false hope that - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'False hope?' repeated Professor McGonagall, still refusing to look round at Professor Umbridge. 'He has achieved high marks in all his Defence Against the Dark Arts tests - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you will see from my note, Harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I should have made my meaning plainer,' said Professor McGonagall, turning at last to look Umbridge directly in the eyes. 'He has achieved high marks in all Defence Against the Dark Arts tests set by a competent teacher.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor Umbridge's smile vanished as suddenly as a light bulb blowing. She sat back in her chair, turned a sheet on her clipboard and began scribbling very fast indeed, her bulging eyes rolling from side to side. Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, her thin nostrils flared, her eyes burning.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Any questions, Potter?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes,' said Harry. 'What sort of character and aptitude tests do the Ministry do on you, if you get enough NEWTs?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, you'll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth,' said Professor McGonagall, 'perseverance and dedication, because Auror training takes a further three years, not to mention very high skills in practical Defence. It will mean a lot more study even after you've left school, so unless you're prepared to - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I think you'll also find,' said Umbridge, her voice very cold now, 'that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Aurors. Their criminal records.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 '- unless you're prepared to take even more exams after Hogwarts, you should really look at another - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an Auror as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'A very good chance, then,' said Professor McGonagall.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Potter has a criminal record,' said Umbridge loudly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Potter has been cleared of all charges,' said McGonagall, even more loudly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor Umbridge stood up. She was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference, but her fussy, simpering demeanour had given place to a hard fury that made her broad, flabby face look oddly sinister.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor McGonagall got to her feet, too, and in her case this was a much more impressive move: she towered over Professor Umbridge.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Potter,' she said in ringing tones, 'I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly, I will make sure you achieve the required results!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The Minister for Magic will never employ Harry Potter!' said Umbridge, her voice rising furiously.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There may well be a new Minister for Magic by the time Potter is ready to join!' shouted Professor McGonagall.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Aha! shrieked Professor Umbridge, pointing a stubby linger at McGonagall. 'Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Of course! That's what you want, isn't it, Minerva McGonagall? You want Cornelius Fudge replaced by Albus Dumbledore! You think you'll be where I am, don't you: Senior Undersecretary to the Minister and Headmistress to boot!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You are raving,' said Professor McGonagall, superbly disdainful. Totter, that concludes our careers consultation.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room, not daring to look at Professor Umbridge. He could hear her and Professor McGonagall continuing to shout at each other all the way back along the corridor.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor Umbridge was still breathing as though she had just run a race when she strode into their Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson that afternoon.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I hope you've thought better of what you were planning to do, Harry,' Hermione whispered, the moment they had opened their books to 'Chapter Thirty-four, Non-Retaliation and Negotiation'. 'Umbridge looks like she's in a really bad mood already . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Every now and then Umbridge shot glowering looks at Harry, who kept his head down, staring at Defensive Magical Theory, his eyes unfocused, thinking . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He could just imagine Professor McGonagall's reaction if he was caught trespassing in Professor Umbridge's office mere hours after she had vouched for him . . . there was nothing to stop him simply going back to Gryffindor Tower and hoping that some time during the next summer holidays he would have a chance to ask Sirius about the scene he had witnessed in the Pensieve . . . nothing, except that the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel as though a lead weight had dropped into his stomach . . . and then there was the matter of Fred and George, whose diversion was already planned, not to mention the knife Sirius had given him, which was currently residing in his schoolbag along with his father's old Invisibility Cloak.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But the fact remained that if he was caught . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Dumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school, Harry!' whispered Hermione, raising her book to hide her face from\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Umbridge. 'And if you get thrown out today it will all have been for nothing!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the memory of what his father had done on a summer's day more than twenty years ago . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And then he remembered Sirius in the fire upstairs in the Gryffindor common room . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 You're less like your father than I thought . . . the risk would've been what made it fun for James . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But did he want to be like his father any more?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry, don't do it, please don't do it!' Hermione said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the class.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He did not answer; he did not know what to do.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron seemed determined to give neither his opinion nor his advice; he would not look at Harry, though when Hermione opened her mouth to try dissuading Harry some more, he said in a low voice, 'Give it a rest, OK? He can make up his own mind.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry's heart beat very fast as he left the classroom. He was halfway along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistakeable sounds of a diversion going off in the distance. There were screams and yells reverberating from somewhere above them; people exiting the classrooms all around Harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfully - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Umbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her short legs would carry her. Pulling out her wand, she hurried off in the opposite direction: it was now or never.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry - please!' Hermione pleaded weakly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But he had made up his mind; hitching his bag more securely on to his shoulder, he set off at a run, weaving in and out of students now hurrying in the opposite direction to see what all the fuss was about in the east wing.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry reached the corridor to Umbridge's office and found it deserted. Dashing behind a large suit of armour whose helmet creaked around to watch him, he pulled open his bag, seized Sirius's knife and donned the Invisibility Cloak. He then crept slowly and carefully back out from behind the suit of armour and along the corridor until he reached Umbridge's door.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it and moved it gently up and down, then withdrew it. There was a tiny click, and the door swung open. He ducked inside the office, closed the door quickly behind him and looked around.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Nothing was moving except the horrible kittens that were still frolicking on the wall plates above the confiscated broomsticks.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry pulled off his Cloak and, striding over to the fireplace, found what he was looking for within seconds: a small box containing glittering Floo powder.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He crouched down in front of the empty grate, his hands shaking. He had never done this before, though he thought he knew how it must work. Sticking his head into the fireplace, he took a large pinch of powder and dropped it on to the logs stacked neatly beneath him. They exploded at once into emerald green flames.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!' Harry said loudly and clearly\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experienced. He had travelled by Floo powder before, of course, but then it had been his entire body that had spun around and around ir. the flames through the network of wizarding fireplaces that stretchec over the country. This time, his knees remained firm upon the cole floor of Umbridge's office, and only his head hurtled through the emerald fire . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And then, as abruptly as it had begun, the spinning stopped. Feeling rather sick and as though he were wearing an exceptionally hot muffler around his head, Harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up out of the kitchen fireplace at the long, wooden table, where a man sat poring over a piece of parchment.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Sirius?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The man jumped and looked around. It was not Sirius, bu. Lupin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry!' he said, looking thoroughly shocked. 'What are you - 'what's happened, is everything all right?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah,' said Harry. 'I just wondered - I mean, I just fancied a - 'a chat with Sirius.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'll call him,' said Lupin, getting to his feet, still looking perplexed, 'he went upstairs to look for Kreacher, he seems to be hiding in the attic again . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And Harry saw Lupin hurry out of the kitchen. Now he was left with nothing to look at but the chair and table legs. He wondered why Sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak out of the fire; his knees were already objecting painfully to their prolonged contact with Umbridge's hard stone floor.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Lupin returned with Sirius at his heels moments later.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What is it?' said Sirius urgently, sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire, so that he and Harry were on a level. Lupin knelt down too, looking very concerned. 'Are you all right? Do you need help?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' said Harry, 'it's nothing like that . . . I just wanted to talk . . . about my dad.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They exchanged a look of great surprise, but Harry did not have time to feel awkward or embarrassed; his knees were becoming sorer by the second and he guessed five minutes had already passed from the start of the diversion; George had only guaranteed him twenty. He therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he had seen in the Pensieve.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 When he had finished, neither Sirius nor Lupin spoke for a moment. Then Lupin said quietly, 'I wouldn't like you to judge your father on what you saw there, Harry. He was only fifteen - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm fifteen' said Harry heatedly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Look, Harry' said Sirius placatingly, 'James and Snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of those things, you can understand that, can't you? I think James was everything Snape wanted to be - he was popular, he was good at Quidditch - good at pretty much everything. And Snape was just this little oddball who was up to his eyes in the Dark Arts, and James - whatever else he may have appeared to you, Harry - always hated the Dark Arts.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah,' said Harry, 'but he just attacked Snape for no good reason, just because - well, just because you said you were bored,' he finished, with a slightly apologetic note in his voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm not proud of it,' said Sirius quickly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Lupin looked sideways at Sirius, then said, 'Look, Harry, what you've got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did - everyone thought they were the height of cool - if they sometimes got a bit carried away - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'If we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,' said Sirius.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Lupin smiled.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He kept messing up his hair,' said Harry in a pained voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Sirius and Lupin laughed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'd forgotten he used to do that,' said Sirius affectionately.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Was he playing with the Snitch?' said Lupin eagerly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah,' said Harry, watching uncomprehendingly as Sirius and Lupin beamed reminiscently. 'Well . . . I thought he was a bit of an idiot.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Of course he was a bit of an idiot!' said Sirius bracingly, 'we were all idiots! Well - not Moony so much,' he said fairly, looking at Lupin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But Lupin shook his head. 'Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape?' he said. 'Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah, well,' said Sirius, 'you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes . . . that was something . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And,' said Harry doggedly, determined to say everything that was on his mind now he was here, 'he kept looking over at the girls by the lake, hoping they were watching him!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, well, he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was around,' said Sirius, shrugging, 'he couldn't stop himself showing off whenever he got near her.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'How come she married him?' Harry asked miserably. 'She hated him!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nah, she didn't,' said Sirius.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'She started going out with him in seventh year,' said Lupin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Once James had deflated his head a bit,' said Sirius.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,' said Lupin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Even Snape?' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well,' said Lupin slowly, 'Snape was a special case. I mean, he never lost an opportunity to curse James so you couldn't really expect James to take that lying down, could you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And my mum was OK with that?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'She didn't know too much about it, to tell you the truth,' said Sirius. 'I mean, James didn't take Snape on dates with her and jinx him in front of her, did he?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Sirius frowned at Harry, who was still looking unconvinced.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Look,' he said, 'your father was the best friend I ever had and he was a good person. A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen. He grew out of it.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah, OK,' said Harry heavily. 'I just never thought I'd feel sorry for Snape.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Now you mention it,' said Lupin, a faint crease between his eyebrows, 'how did Snape react when he found you'd seen all this?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He told me he'd never teach me Occlumency again,' said Harry indifferently, 'like that's a big disappoint-\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He WHAT?' shouted Sirius, causing Harry to jump and inhale a mouthful of ashes.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Are you serious, Harry?' said Lupin quickly. 'He's stopped giving you lessons?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah,' said Harry, surprised at what he considered a great over-reaction. 'But it's OK, I don't care, it's a bit of a relief to tell you the - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm coming up there to have a word with Snape!' said Sirius forcefully, and he actually made to stand up, but Lupin wrenched him back down again.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'If anyone's going to tell Snape it will be me!' he said firmly. 'But Harry, first of all, you're to go back to Snape and tell him that on no account is he to stop giving you lessons - when Dumbledore hears - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I can't tell him that, he'd kill me!' said Harry, outraged. 'You didn't see him when we got out of the Pensieve.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry there is nothing so important as you learning Occlumency!' said Lupin sternly. 'Do you understand me? Nothing!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'OK, OK,' said Harry, thoroughly discomposed, not to mention annoyed. 'I'll . . . I'll try and say something to him . . . but it won't be - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He fell silent. He could hear distant footsteps.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Is that Kreacher coming downstairs?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' said Sirius, glancing behind him. 'It must be somebody your end.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry's heart skipped several beats.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'd better go!' he said hastily and pulled his head backwards out of the Grimmauld Place fire. For a moment his head seemed to be revolving on his shoulders, then he found himself kneeling in front of Umbridge's fire with it firmly back on and watching the emerald flames flicker and die.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Quickly, quickly!' he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside the office door. 'Ah, she's left it open - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry dived for the Invisibility Cloak and had just managed to pull it back over himself when Filch burst into the office. He looked absolutely delighted about something and was talking to himself feverishly as he crossed the room, pulled open a drawer in Umbridge's desk and began rifling through the papers inside it.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Approval for Whipping . . . Approval for Whipping . . . I can do it at last . . . they've had it coming to them for years . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He pulled out a piece of parchment, kissed it, then shuffled rapidly back out of the door, clutching it to his chest.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry leapt to his feet and, making sure he had his bag and that the Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him, he wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after Filch, who was hobbling along faster than Harry had ever seen him go.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 One landing down from Umbridge's office, Harry thought it was safe to become visible again. He pulled off the Cloak, shoved it in his bag and hurried onwards. There was a great deal of shouting and movement coming from the Entrance Hall. He ran down the marble staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled there.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked. Students were standing all around the walls in a great ring (some of them, Harry noticed, covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap); teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd. Prominent among the onlookers were members of the Inquisitorial Squad, who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves, and Peeves, who was bobbing overhead, gazed down at Fred and George who stood in the middle of the floor with the unmistakeable look of two people who had just been cornered.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So!' said Umbridge triumphantly. Harry realised she was standing\\u00a0 \\u00a0 just a few stairs in front of him, once more looking down upon her prey. 'So - you think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp, do you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Pretty amusing, yeah,' said Fred, looking up at her without the slightest sign of fear.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Filch elbowed his way closer to Umbridge, almost crying with happiness.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I've got the form, Headmistress,' he said hoarsely, waving the piece of parchment Harry had just seen him take from her desk. 'I've got the form and I've got the whips waiting . . . oh, let me do it now . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Very good, Argus,' she said. 'You two,' she went on, gazing down at Fred and George, 'are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You know what?' said Fred. 'I don't think we are.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He turned to his twin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'George,' said Fred, 'I think we've outgrown full-time education.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah, I've been feeling that way myself,' said George lightly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Time to test our talents in the real world, d'you reckon?' asked Fred.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Definitely,' said George.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And before Umbridge could say a word, they raised their wands and said together:\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Accio brooms!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance. Looking to his left, he ducked just in time. Fred and George's broomsticks, one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge had fastened them to the wall, were hurtling along the corridor towards their owners; they turned left, streaked down the stairs and stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'We won't be seeing you,' Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging his leg over his broomstick.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah, don't bother to keep in touch,' said George, mounting his own.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Fred looked around at the assembled students, at the silent, watchful crowd.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp, as demonstrated upstairs, come to number ninety-three, Diagon Alley - Weasley' Wizarding Wheezes,' he said in a loud voice. 'Our new premises!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Special discounts to Hogwarts students who swear they're going to use our products to get rid of this old bat,' added George, pointing at Professor Umbridge.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'STOP THEM!' shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late. As the Inquisitorial Squad closed in, Fred and George kicked off from the floor, shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging dangerously below. Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his level above the crowd.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Give her hell from us, Peeves.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And Peeves, who Harry had never seen take an order from a student before, swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset.\\u00a0\\\"\",\n          \"\\u00a0  I don't believe it!\\\\ Ron said, in a stunned voice, as the Hogwarts students filed back up the steps behind the party from Durmstrang. \\\\\\\"Krum, Harry! Viktor Krum!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"For heaven's sake, Ron, he's only a Quidditch player,\\\\\\\" said Hermione.  \\\\\\\"Only a Quidditch player?\\\\\\\" Ron said, looking at her as though he couldn't believe his ears. \\\\\\\"Hermione - he's one of the best Seekers in the world! I had no idea he was still at school!\\\\\\\"  As they recrossed the entrance hall with the rest of the Hogwarts students heading for the Great Hall, Harry saw Lee Jordan jumping up and down on the soles of his feet to get a better look at the back of Krum's head. Several sixth-year girls were frantically searching their pockets as they walked - \\\\\\\"Oh I don't believe it, I haven't got a single quill on me -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"D'you think he'd sign my hat in lipstick?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Really,\\\\\\\" Hermione said loftily as they passed the girls, now squabbling over the lipstick.  \\\\\\\"I'm getting his autograph if I can,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"You haven't got a quill, have you, Harry?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Nope, they're upstairs in my bag,\\\\\\\" said Harry.  They walked over to the Gryffindor table and sat down. Ron took care to sit on the side facing the doorway, because Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students were still gathered around it, apparently unsure about where they should sit. The students from Beauxbatons had chosen seats at the Ravenclaw table. They were looking around the Great Hall with glum expressions on their faces. Three of them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads.  \\\\\\\"It's not that cold,\\\\\\\" said Hermione defensively. \\\\\\\"Why didn't they bring cloaks?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Over here! Come and sit over here!\\\\\\\" Ron hissed. \\\\\\\"Over here! Hermione, budge up, make a space -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Too late,\\\\\\\" said Ron bitterly.  Viktor Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students had settled themselves at the Slytherin table. Harry could see Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle looking very smug about this. As he watched, Malfoy bent forward to speak to Krum.  \\\\\\\"Yeah, that's right, smarm up to him, Malfoy,\\\\\\\" said Ron scathingly. \\\\\\\"I bet Krum can see right through him, though. . . bet he gets people fawning over him all the time.. . .  Where d'you reckon they're going to sleep? We could offer him a space in our dormitory, Harry. . . I wouldn't mind giving him my bed, I could kip on a camp bed.\\\\\\\"  Hermione snorted.  \\\\\\\"They look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot,\\\\\\\" said Harry. The Durmstrang students were pulling off their heavy furs and looking up at the starry black ceiling with expressions of interest; a couple of them were picking up the golden plates and goblets and examining them, apparently impressed.  Up at the staff table, Filch, the caretaker, was adding chairs. He was wearing his moldy old tailcoat in honor of the occasion. Harry was surprised to see that he added four chairs, two on either side of Dumbledore's.  \\\\\\\"But there are only two extra people,\\\\\\\" Harry said. \\\\\\\"Why's Filch putting out four chairs, who else is coming?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Eh?\\\\\\\" said Ron vaguely. He was still staring avidly at Krum.  When all the students had entered the Hall and settled down at their House tables, the staff entered, filing up to the top table and taking their seats. Last in line were Professor Dumbledore, Professor Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime. When their headmistress appeared, the pupils from Beauxbatons leapt to their feet. A few of the Hogwarts students laughed. The Beauxbatons party appeared quite unembarrassed, however, and did not resume their seats until Madame Maxime had sat down on Dumbledore's left-hand side.  Dumbledore remained standing, and a silence fell over the Great Hall.  \\\\\\\"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and - most particularly - guests,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore, beaming around at the foreign students. \\\\\\\"I have great pleasure in welcoming you all to Hogwarts. I hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and enjoyable.\\\\\\\"  One of the Beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler around her head gave what was unmistakably a derisive laugh.  \\\\\\\"No one's making you stay!\\\\\\\" Hermione whispered, bristling at her.  \\\\\\\"The tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore. \\\\\\\"I now invite you all to eat, drink, and make yourselves at home!\\\\\\\"  He sat down, and Harry saw Karkaroff lean forward at once and engage him in conversation.  The plates in front of them filled with food as usual. The house-elves in the kitchen seemed to have pulled out all the stops; there was a greater variety of dishes in front of them than Harry had ever seen, including several that were definitely foreign.  \\\\\\\"What's that?\\\\\\\" said Ron, pointing at a large dish of some sort of shellfish stew that stood beside a large steak-and-kidney pudding.  \\\\\\\"Bouillabaisse,\\\\\\\" said Hermione.  \\\\\\\"Bless you,\\\\\\\" said Ron.  \\\\\\\"It's French,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, \\\\\\\"I had it on holiday summer before last. It's very nice.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I'll take your word for it,\\\\\\\" said Ron, helping himself to black pudding.  The Great Hall seemed somehow much more crowded than usual, even though there were barely twenty additional students there; perhaps it was because their differently colored uniforms stood out so clearly against the black of the Hogwarts' robes. Now that they had removed their furs, the Durmstrang students were revealed to be wearing robes of a deep bloodred.  Hagrid sidled into the Hall through a door behind the staff table twenty minutes after the start of the feast. He slid into his seat at the end and waved at Harry, Ron, and Hermione with a very heavily bandaged hand.  \\\\\\\"Skrewts doing all right, Hagrid?\\\\\\\" Harry called.  \\\\\\\"Thrivin',\\\\\\\" Hagrid called back happily.  \\\\\\\"Yeah, I'll just bet they are,\\\\\\\" said Ron quietly. \\\\\\\"Looks like they've finally found a food they like, doesn't it? Hagrid's fingers.\\\\\\\"  At that moment, a voice said, \\\\\\\"Excuse me, are you wanting ze bouillabaisse?\\\\\\\"  It was the girl from Beauxbatons who had laughed during Dumbledore's speech. She had finally removed her muffler. A long sheet of silvery-blonde hair fell almost to her waist. She had large, deep blue eyes, and very white, even teeth.  Ron went purple. He stared up at her, opened his mouth to reply, but nothing came out except a faint gurgling noise.  \\\\\\\"Yeah, have it,\\\\\\\" said Harry, pushing the dish toward the girl.  \\\\\\\"You 'ave finished wiz it?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Yeah,\\\\\\\" Ron said breathlessly. \\\\\\\"Yeah, it was excellent.\\\\\\\"  The girl picked up the dish and carried it carefully off to the Ravenclaw table. Ron was still goggling at the girl as though he had never seen one before. Harry started to laugh. The sound seemed to jog Ron back to his senses.  \\\\\\\"She's a veela!\\\\\\\" he said hoarsely to Harry.  \\\\\\\"Of course she isn't!\\\\\\\" said Hermione tartly. \\\\\\\"I don't see anyone else gaping at her like an idiot!\\\\\\\"  But she wasn't entirely right about that. As the girl crossed the Hall, many boys' heads turned, and some of them seemed to have become temporarily speechless, just like Ron.  \\\\\\\"I'm telling you, that's not a normal girl!\\\\\\\" said Ron, leaning sideways so he could keep a clear view of her. \\\\\\\"They don't make them like that at Hogwarts!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"They make them okay at Hogwarts,\\\\\\\" said Harry without thinking. Cho happened to be sitting only a few places away from the girl with the silvery hair.  \\\\\\\"When you've both put your eyes back in,\\\\\\\" said Hermione briskly, \\\\\\\"you'll be able to see who's just arrived.\\\\\\\"  She was pointing up at the staff table. The two remaining empty seats had just been filled. Ludo Bagman was now sitting on Professor Karkaroff's other side, while Mr.  Crouch, Percy's boss, was next to Madame Maxime.  \\\\\\\"What are they doing here?\\\\\\\" said Harry in surprise.  \\\\\\\"They organized the Triwizard Tournament, didn't they?\\\\\\\" said Hermione. \\\\\\\"I suppose they wanted to be here to see it start.\\\\\\\"  When the second course arrived they noticed a number of unfamiliar desserts too. Ron examined an odd sort of pale blancmange closely, then moved it carefully a few inches to his right, so that it would be clearly visible from the Ravenclaw table. The girl who looked like a veela appeared to have eaten enough, however, and did not come over to get it.  Once the golden plates had been wiped clean, Dumbledore stood up again. A pleasant sort of tension seemed to fill the Hall now. Harry felt a slight thrill of excitement, wondering what was coming. Several seats down from them, Fred and George were leaning forward, staring at Dumbledore with great concentration.  \\\\\\\"The moment has come,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore, smiling around at the sea of upturned faces. \\\\\\\"The Triwizard Tournament is about to start. I would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"The what?\\\\\\\" Harry muttered.  Ron shrugged.  \\\\\\\"- just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year. But first, let me introduce, for those who do not know them, Mr. Bartemius Crouch, Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation\\\\\\\" - there was a smattering of polite applause - \\\\\\\"and Mr. Ludo Bagman, Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports.\\\\\\\"  There was a much louder round of applause for Bagman than for Crouch, perhaps because of his fame as a Beater, or simply because he looked so much more likable. He acknowledged it with a jovial wave of his hand. Bartemius Crouch did not smile or wave when his name was announced. Remembering him in his neat suit at the Quidditch World Cup, Harry thought he looked strange in wizard's robes. His toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd next to Dumbledore's long white hair and beard.  \\\\\\\"Mr. Bagman and Mr. Crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on the arrangements for the Triwizard Tournament,\\\\\\\" Dumbledore continued, \\\\\\\"and they will be joining myself, Professor Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime on the panel that will judge the champions' efforts.\\\\\\\"  At the mention of the word \\\\\\\"champions,\\\\\\\" the attentiveness of the listening students seemed to sharpen. Perhaps Dumbledore had noticed their sudden stillness, for he smiled as he said, \\\\\\\"The casket, then, if you please, Mr. Filch.\\\\\\\"  Filch, who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the Hall, now approached Dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels. It looked extremely old.  A murmur of excited interest rose from the watching students; Dennis Creevey actually stood on his chair to see it properly, but, being so tiny, his head hardly rose above anyone else's.  \\\\\\\"The instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by Mr. Crouch and Mr. Bagman,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore as Filch placed the chest carefully on the table before him, \\\\\\\"and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge. There will be three tasks, spaced throughout the school year, and they will test the champions in many different ways.. their magical prowess - their daring -their powers of deduction - and, of course, their ability to cope with danger.\\\\\\\"  At this last word, the Hall was filled with a silence so absolute that nobody seemed to be breathing.  \\\\\\\"As you know, three champions compete in the tournament,\\\\\\\" Dumbledore went on calmly, \\\\\\\"one from each of the participating schools. They will be marked on how well they perform each of the Tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the Triwizard Cup. The champions will be chosen by an impartial selector: the Goblet of Fire.\\\\\\\"  Dumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times upon the top of the casket. The lid creaked slowly open. Dumbledore reached inside it and pulled out a large, roughly hewn wooden cup. It would have been entirely unremarkable had it not been full to the brim with dancing blue-white flames.  Dumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on top of it, where it would be clearly visible to everyone in the Hall.  \\\\\\\"Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore. \\\\\\\"Aspiring champions have twenty-four hours in which to put their names forward. Tomorrow night, Halloween, the goblet will return the names of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools. The goblet will be placed in the entrance hall tonight, where it will be freely accessible to all those wishing to compete.  \\\\\\\"To ensure that no underage student yields to temptation,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore, \\\\\\\"I will be drawing an Age Line around the Goblet of Fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall. Nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this line.  \\\\\\\"Finally, I wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this tournament is not to be entered into lightly. Once a champion has been selected by the Goblet of Fire, he or she is obliged to see the tournament through to the end. The placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a binding, magical contract. There can be no change of heart once you have become a champion. Please be very sure, therefore, that you are wholeheartedly prepared to play before you drop your name into the goblet. Now, I think it is time for bed. Good night to you all.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"An Age Line!\\\\\\\" Fred Weasley said, his eyes glinting, as they all made their way across the Hall to the doors into the entrance hall. \\\\\\\"Well, that should be fooled by an Aging Potion, shouldn't it? And once your name's in that goblet, you're laughing - it can't tell whether you're seventeen or not!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But I don't think anyone under seventeen will stand a chance,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, \\\\\\\"we just haven't learned enough. . .\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Speak for yourself,\\\\\\\" said George shortly. \\\\\\\"You'll try and get in, won't you, Harry?\\\\\\\"  Harry thought briefly of Dumbledore's insistence that nobody under seventeen should submit their name, but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the Triwizard Tournament filled his mind again. .. . He wondered how angry Dumbledore would be if someone younger than seventeen did find a way to get over the Age Line.  \\\\\\\"Where is he?\\\\\\\" said Ron, who wasn't listening to a word of this conversation, but looking through the crowd to see what had become of Krum. \\\\\\\"Dumbledore didn't say where the Durmstrang people are sleeping, did he?\\\\\\\"  But this query was answered almost instantly; they were level with the Slytherin table now, and Karkaroff had just bustled up to his students.  \\\\\\\"Back to the ship, then,\\\\\\\" he was saying. \\\\\\\"Viktor, how are you feeling? Did you eat enough? Should I send for some mulled wine from the kitchens?\\\\\\\"  Harry saw Krum shake his head as he pulled his furs back on. \\\\\\\"Professor, Ivood like some vine,\\\\\\\" said one of the other Durmstrang boys hopefully.  \\\\\\\"I wasn't offering it to you, Poliakoff,\\\\\\\" snapped Karkaroff, his warmly paternal air vanishing in an instant. \\\\\\\"I notice you have dribbled food all down the front of your robes again, disgusting boy -\\\\\\\"  Karkaroff turned and led his students toward the doors, reaching them at exactly the same moment as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Harry stopped to let him walk through first.  \\\\\\\"Thank you,\\\\\\\" said Karkaroff carelessly, glancing at him. And then Karkaroff froze. He turned his head back to Harry and stared at him as though he couldn't believe his eyes.  Behind their headmaster, the students from Durmstrang came to a halt too. Karkaroff's eyes moved slowly up Harry's face and fixed upon his scar. The Durmstrang students were staring curiously at Harry too. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw comprehension dawn on a few of their faces. The boy with food all down his front nudged the girl next to him and pointed openly at Harry's forehead.  \\\\\\\"Yeah, that's Harry Potter,\\\\\\\" said a growling voice from behind them.  Professor Karkaroff spun around. Mad-Eye Moody was standing there, leaning heavily on his staff, his magical eye glaring unblinkingly at the Durmstrang headmaster.  The color drained from Karkaroff's face as Harry watched. A terrible look of mingled fury and fear came over him.  \\\\\\\"You!\\\\\\\" he said, staring at Moody as though unsure he was really seeing him.  \\\\\\\"Me,\\\\\\\" said Moody grimly. \\\\\\\"And unless you've got anything to say to Potter, Karkaroff, you might want to move. You're blocking the doorway.\\\\\\\"  It was true; half the students in the Hall were now waiting behind them, looking over one another's shoulders to see what was causing the holdup.  Without another word, Professor Karkaroff swept his students away with him. Moody watched him until he was out of sight, his magical eye fixed upon his back, a look of intense dislike upon his mutilated face.  As the next day was Saturday, most students would normally have breakfasted late. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were not alone in rising much earlier than they usually did on weekends. When they went down into the entrance hall, they saw about twenty people milling around it, some of them eating toast, all examining the Goblet of Fire. It had been placed in the center of the hall on the stool that normally bore the Sorting Hat. A thin golden line had been traced on the floor, forming a circle ten feet around it in every direction.  \\\\\\\"Anyone put their name in yet?\\\\\\\" Ron asked a third-year girl eagerly.  \\\\\\\"All the Durmstrang lot,\\\\\\\" she replied. \\\\\\\"But I haven't seen anyone from Hogwarts yet.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Bet some of them put it in last night after we'd all gone to bed,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"I would've if it had been me. . . wouldn't have wanted everyone watching. What if the goblet just gobbed you right back out again?\\\\\\\"  Someone laughed behind Harry. Turning, he saw Fred, George, and Lee Jordan hurrying down the staircase, all three of them looking extremely excited.  \\\\\\\"Done it,\\\\\\\" Fred said in a triumphant whisper to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \\\\\\\"Just taken it.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\" said Ron.  \\\\\\\"The Aging Potion, dung brains,\\\\\\\" said Fred.  \\\\\\\"One drop each,\\\\\\\" said George, rubbing his hands together with glee. \\\\\\\"We only need to be a few months older.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"We're going to split the thousand Galleons between the three of us if one of us wins,\\\\\\\"  said Lee, grinning broadly.  \\\\\\\"I'm not sure this is going to work, you know,\\\\\\\" said Hermione warningly. \\\\\\\"I'm sure Dumbledore will have thought of this.\\\\\\\"  Fred, George, and Lee ignored her.  \\\\\\\"Ready?\\\\\\\" Fred said to the other two, quivering with excitement. \\\\\\\"C'mon, then - I'll go first -\\\\\\\"  Harry watched, fascinated, as Fred pulled a slip of parchment out of his pocket bearing the words Fred Weasley - Hogwarts. Fred walked right up to the edge of the line and stood there, rocking on his toes like a diver preparing for a fifty-foot drop. Then, with the eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon him, he took a great breath and stepped over the line.  For a split second Harry thought it had worked - George certainly thought so, for he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after Fred - but next moment, there was a loud sizzling sound, and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though they had been thrown by an invisible shot-putter. They landed painfully, ten feet away on the cold stone floor, and to add insult to injury, there was a loud popping noise, and both of them sprouted identical long white beards.  The entrance hall rang with laughter. Even Fred and George joined in, once they had gotten to their feet and taken a good look at each other's beards.  \\\\\\\"I did warn you,\\\\\\\" said a deep, amused voice, and everyone turned to see Professor Dumbledore coming out of the Great Hall. He surveyed Fred and George, his eyes twinkling. \\\\\\\"I suggest you both go up to Madam Pomfrey. She is already tending to Miss Fawcett, of Ravenclaw, and Mr. Summers, of Hufflepuff, both of whom decided to age themselves up a little too. Though I must say, neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yours.\\\\\\\"  Fred and George set off for the hospital wing, accompanied by Lee, who was howling with laughter, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione, also chortling, went in to breakfast.  The decorations in the Great Hall had changed this morning. As it was Halloween, a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling, while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner. Harry led the way over to Dean and Seamus, who were discussing those Hogwarts students of seventeen or over who might be entering.  \\\\\\\"There's a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his name in,\\\\\\\" Dean told Harry. \\\\\\\"That big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a sloth.\\\\\\\"  Harry, who had played Quidditch against Warrington, shook his head in disgust.  \\\\\\\"We can't have a Slytherin champion!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory,\\\\\\\" said Seamus contemptuously. \\\\\\\"But I wouldn't have thought he'd have wanted to risk his good looks.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Listen!\\\\\\\" said Hermione suddenly.  People were cheering out in the entrance hall. They all swiveled around in their seats  and saw Angelina Johnson coming into the Hall, grinning in an embarrassed sort of way. A tall black girl who played Chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Angelina came over to them, sat down, and said, \\\\\\\"Well, I've done it! Just put my name in!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"You're kidding!\\\\\\\" said Ron, looking impressed.  \\\\\\\"Are you seventeen, then?\\\\\\\" asked Harry.  \\\\\\\"Course she is, can't see a beard, can you?\\\\\\\" said Ron.  \\\\\\\"I had my birthday last week,\\\\\\\" said Angelina.  \\\\\\\"Well, I'm glad someone from Gryffindor's entering,\\\\\\\" said Hermione. \\\\\\\"I really hope you get it, Angelina!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Thanks, Hermione,\\\\\\\" said Angelina, smiling at her.  Yeah, better you than Pretty-Boy Diggory, said Seamus, causing several Hufflepuffs passing their table to scowl heavily at him.  \\\\\\\"What're we going to do today, then?\\\\\\\" Ron asked Harry and Hermione when they had finished breakfast and were leaving the Great Hall.  \\\\\\\"We haven't been down to visit Hagrid yet,\\\\\\\" said Harry.  \\\\\\\"Okay,\\\\\\\" said Ron, \\\\\\\"just as long as he doesn't ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewts.\\\\\\\"  A look of great excitement suddenly dawned on Hermione's face.  \\\\\\\"I've just realized - I haven't asked Hagrid to join S.P.E.W. yet!\\\\\\\" she said brightly.  \\\\\\\"Wait for me, will you, while I nip upstairs and get the badges?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What is it with her?\\\\\\\" said Ron, exasperated, as Hermione ran away up the marble staircase.  \\\\\\\"Hey, Ron,\\\\\\\" said Harry suddenly. \\\\\\\"It's your friend. . .\\\\\\\"  The students from Beauxbatons were coming through the front doors from the grounds, among them, the veela-girl. Those gathered around the Goblet of Fire stood back to let them pass, watching eagerly.  Madame Maxime entered the hall behind her students and organized them into a line. One by one, the Beauxbatons students stepped across the Age Line and dropped their slips of parchment into the blue-white flames. As each name entered the fire, it turned briefly red and emitted sparks.  \\\\\\\"What d'you reckon'll happen to the ones who aren't chosen?\\\\\\\" Ron muttered to Harry as the veela-girl dropped her parchment into the Goblet of Fire. \\\\\\\"Reckon they'll go back to school, or hang around to watch the tournament?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Dunno,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Hang around, I suppose... . Madame Maxime's staying to judge, isn't she?\\\\\\\"  When all the Beauxbatons students had submitted their names, Madame Maxime led them back out of the hall and out onto the grounds again.  \\\\\\\"Where are they sleeping, then?\\\\\\\" said Ron, moving toward the front doors and staring after them.  A loud rattling noise behind them announced Hermione's reappearance with the box of S. P.  E.W. badges.  \\\\\\\"Oh good, hurry up,\\\\\\\" said Ron, and he jumped down the stone steps, keeping his eyes on the back of the veela-girl, who was now halfway across the lawn with Madame Maxime.  As they neared Hagrid's cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, the mystery of the Beauxbatons' sleeping quarters was solved. The gigantic powder-blue carriage in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred yards from Hagrid's front door, and the students were climbing back inside it. The elephantine flying horses that had pulled the carriage were now grazing in a makeshift paddock alongside it.  Harry knocked on Hagrid's door, and Fang's booming barks answered instantly.  \\\\\\\"Bout time!\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, when he'd flung open the door. \\\\\\\"Thought you lot'd forgotten where I live!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"We've been really busy, Hag -\\\\\\\" Hermione started to say, but then she stopped dead, looking up at Hagrid, apparently lost for words.  Hagrid was wearing his best (and very horrible) hairy brown suit, plus a checked yellow-and-orange tie. This wasn't the worst of it, though; he had evidently tried to tame his hair, using large quantities of what appeared to be axle grease. It was now slicked down into two bunches - perhaps he had tried a ponytail like Bill's, but found he had too much hair. The look didn't really suit Hagrid at all. For a moment, Hermione goggled at him, then, obviously deciding not to comment, she said, \\\\\\\"Erm - where are the skrewts.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Out by the pumpkin patch,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid happily. \\\\\\\"They're get-tin' massive, mus' be  nearly three foot long now. On'y trouble is, they've started killin' each other.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Oh no, really?\\\\\\\" said Hermione, shooting a repressive look at Ron, who, staring at Hagrid's odd hairstyle, had just opened his mouth to say something about it.  \\\\\\\"Yeah,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid sadly. \\\\\\\"S' okay, though, I've got 'em in separate boxes now. Still got abou' twenty.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Well, that's lucky,\\\\\\\" said Ron. Hagrid missed the sarcasm.  Hagrid's cabin comprised a single room, in one corner of which was a gigantic bed covered in a patchwork quilt. A similarly enormous wooden table and chairs stood in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured hams and dead birds hanging from the ceiling. They sat down at the table while Hagrid started to make tea, and were soon immersed in yet more discussion of the Triwizard Tournament. Hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they were.  \\\\\\\"You wait,\\\\\\\" he said, grinning. \\\\\\\"You jus' wait. Yer going ter see some stuff yeh've never seen before. Firs' task. . . ah, but I'm not supposed ter say.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Go on, Hagrid!\\\\\\\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione urged him, but he just shook his head, grinning.  \\\\\\\"I don' want ter spoil it fer yeh,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid. \\\\\\\"But it's gonna be spectacular, I'll tell yeh that. Them champions're going ter have their work cut out. Never thought I'd live ter see the Triwizard Tournament played again!\\\\\\\"  They ended up having lunch with Hagrid, though they didn't eat much - Hagrid had made what he said was a beef casserole, but after Hermione unearthed a large talon in hers, she, Harry, and Ron rather lost their appetites. However, they enjoyed themselves trying to make Hagrid tell them what the tasks in the tournament were going to be, speculating which of the entrants were likely to be selected as champions, and wondering whether Fred and George were beardless yet.  A light rain had started to fall by midafternoon; it was very cozy sitting by the fire, listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window, watching Hagrid darning his socks and arguing with Hermione about house-elves - for he flatly refused to join S.P.E.W. when she showed him her badges.  \\\\\\\"It'd be doin' 'em an unkindness, Hermione,\\\\\\\" he said gravely, threading a massive bone needle with thick yellow yarn. \\\\\\\"It's in their nature ter look after humans, that's what they like, see? Yeh'd be makin' 'em unhappy ter take away their work, an' insutin' 'em if yeh tried ter pay 'em.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But Harry set Dobby free, and he was over the moon about it!\\\\\\\" said Hermione. \\\\\\\"And we heard he's asking for wages now!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Yeah, well, yeh get weirdos in every breed. I'm not sayin' there isn't the odd elf who'd take freedom, but yeh'll never persuade most of 'em ter do it - no, nothin' doin', Hermione.\\\\\\\"  Hermione looked very cross indeed and stuffed her box of badges back into her cloak pocket.  By half past five it was growing dark, and Ron, Harry, and Hermione decided it was time to get back up to the castle for the Halloween feast - and, more important, the announcement of the school champions.  \\\\\\\"I'll come with yeh,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, putting away his darning. \\\\\\\"Jus' give us a sec.\\\\\\\"  Hagrid got up, went across to the chest of drawers beside his bed, and began searching for something inside it. They didn't pay too much attention until a truly horrible smell reached their nostrils. Coughing, Ron said, \\\\\\\"Hagrid, what's that?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Eh?\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, turning around with a large bottle in his hand. \\\\\\\"Don' yeh like it?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Is that aftershave?\\\\\\\" said Hermione in a slightly choked voice.  \\\\\\\"Er - eau de cologne,\\\\\\\" Hagrid muttered. He was blushing.  \\\\\\\"Maybe it's a bit much,\\\\\\\" he said gruffly. \\\\\\\"I'll go take it off, hang on...\\\\\\\"  He stumped out of the cabin, and they saw him washing himself vigorously in the water barrel outside the window.  \\\\\\\"Eau de cologne?\\\\\\\" said Hermione in amazement. \\\\\\\"Hagrid?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"And what's with the hair and the suit?\\\\\\\" said Harry in an undertone.  \\\\\\\"Look!\\\\\\\" said Ron suddenly, pointing out of the window. Hagrid had just straightened up and turned 'round. If he had been blushing before, it was nothing to what he was doing now. Getting to their feet very cautiously, so that Hagrid wouldn't spot them, Harry, Ron, and Hermione peered through the window and saw that Madame Maxime and the Beauxbatons students had just emerged from their carriage, clearly about to set off for the feast too. They couldn't hear what Hagrid was saying, but he was talking to Madame  Maxime with a rapt, misty-eyed expression Harry had only ever seen him wear once before -when he had been looking at the baby dragon, Norbert.  \\\\\\\"He's going up to the castle with her!\\\\\\\" said Hermione indignantly. \\\\\\\"I thought he was waiting for us!\\\\\\\"  Without so much as a backward glance at his cabin, Hagrid was trudging off up the grounds with Madame Maxime, the Beaux-batons students following in their wake, jogging to keep up with their enormous strides.  \\\\\\\"He fancies her!\\\\\\\" said Ron incredulously. \\\\\\\"Well, if they end up having children, they'll be setting a world record - bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a ton.\\\\\\\"  They let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind them. It was surprisingly dark outside. Drawing their cloaks more closely around themselves, they set off up the sloping lawns.  \\\\\\\"Ooh it's them, look!\\\\\\\" Hermione whispered.  The Durmstrang party was walking up toward the castle from the lake. Viktor Krum was walking side by side with Karkaroff, and the other Durmstrang students were straggling along behind them. Ron watched Krum excitedly, but Krum did not look around as he reached the front doors a little ahead of Hermione, Ron, and Harry and proceeded through them.  When they entered the candlelit Great Hall it was almost full. The Goblet of Fire had been moved; it was now standing in front of Dumbledore's empty chair at the teachers' table. Fred and George - clean-shaven again - seemed to have taken their disappointment fairly well.  \\\\\\\"Hope it's Angelina,\\\\\\\" said Fred as Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down.  \\\\\\\"So do I!\\\\\\\" said Hermione breathlessly. \\\\\\\"Well, we'll soon know!\\\\\\\"  The Halloween feast seemed to take much longer than usual. Perhaps because it was their second feast in two days, Harry didn't seem to fancy the extravagantly prepared food as much as he would have normally. Like everyone else in the Hall, judging by the constantly craning necks, the impatient expressions on every face, the fidgeting, and the standing up to see whether Dumbledore had finished eating yet, Harry simply wanted the plates to clear, and to hear who had been selected as champions.  At long last, the golden plates returned to their original spotless state; there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the Hall, which died away almost instantly as Dumbledore got to his feet. On either side of him, Professor Karkaroff and Madame Maxime looked as tense and expectant as anyone. Ludo Bagman was beaming and winking at various students. Mr. Crouch, however, looked quite uninterested, almost bored.  \\\\\\\"Well, the goblet is almost ready to make its decision,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore. \\\\\\\"I estimate that it requires one more minute. Now, when the champions' names are called, I would ask them please to come up to the top of the Hall, walk along the staff table, and go through into the next chamber\\\\\\\" - he indicated the door behind the staff table - \\\\\\\"where they will be receiving their first instructions.\\\\\\\"  He took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it; at once, all the candles except those inside the carved pumpkins were extinguished, plunging them into a state of semidarkness. The Goblet of Fire now shone more brightly than anything in the whole Hall, the sparkling bright, bluey-whiteness of the flames almost painful on the eyes.  Everyone watched, waiting. . . . A few people kept checking their watches. . .  \\\\\\\"Any second,\\\\\\\" Lee Jordan whispered, two seats away from Harry.  The flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red again. Sparks began to fly from it.  Next moment, a tongue of flame shot into the air, a charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it - the whole room gasped.  Dumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held it at arm's length, so that he could read it by the light of the flames, which had turned back to blue-white.  \\\\\\\"The champion for Durmstrang,\\\\\\\" he read, in a strong, clear voice, \\\\\\\"will be Viktor Krum.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No surprises there!\\\\\\\" yelled Ron as a storm of applause and cheering swept the Hall.  Harry saw Viktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table and slouch up toward Dumbledore; he turned right, walked along the staff table, and disappeared through the door into the next chamber.  \\\\\\\"Bravo, Viktor!\\\\\\\" boomed Karkaroff, so loudly that everyone could hear him, even over all the applause. \\\\\\\"Knew you had it in you!\\\\\\\"  The clapping and chatting died down. Now everyone's attention was focused again on the goblet, which, seconds later, turned red once more. A second piece of parchment shot out of it, propelled by the flames.  \\\\\\\"The champion for Beauxbatons,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore, \\\\\\\"is Fleur Delacour!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"It's her, Ron!\\\\\\\" Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.  \\\\\\\"Oh look, they're all disappointed,\\\\\\\" Hermione said over the noise, nodding toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. \\\\\\\"Disappointed\\\\\\\" was a bit of an understatement, Harry thought. Two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms.  When Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side chamber, silence fell again, but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it. The Hogwarts champion next...  And the Goblet of Fire turned red once more; sparks showered out of it; the tongue of flame shot high into the air, and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the third piece of parchment.  \\\\\\\"The Hogwarts champion,\\\\\\\" he called, \\\\\\\"is Cedric Diggory!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No! \\\\\\\" said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar from the next table was too great. Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his or her feet, screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way past them, grinning broadly, and headed off toward the chamber behind the teachers' table. Indeed, the applause for Cedric went on so long that it was some time before Dumbledore could make himself heard again.  \\\\\\\"Excellent!\\\\\\\" Dumbledore called happily as at last the tumult died down. \\\\\\\"Well, we now have our three champions. I am sure I can count upon all of you, including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster. By cheering your champion on, you will contribute in a very real --\\\\\\\"  But Dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking, and it was apparent to everybody what had distracted him.  The fire in the goblet had just turned red again. Sparks were flying out of it. A long flame shot suddenly into the air, and borne upon it was another piece of parchment.  Automatically, it seemed, Dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized the parchment. He held it out and stared at the name written upon it. There was a long pause, during which Dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands, and everyone in the room stared at Dumbledore. And then Dumbledore cleared his throat and read out - \\\\\\\"Harry Potter.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\"\",\n          \"\\u00a0  Dumbledore reckons You-Know-Who's getting stronger again as well?\\\\ Ron whispered.  Everything Harry had seen in the Pensieve, nearly everything Dumbledore had told and shown him afterward, he had now shared with Ron and Hermione - and, of course, with Sirius, to whom Harry had sent an owl the moment he had left Dumbledore's office. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat up late in the common room once again that night, talking it all over until Harry's mind was reeling, until he understood what Dumbledore had meant about a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them off.  Ron stared into the common room fire. Harry thought he saw Ron shiver slightly, even though the evening was warm.  \\\\\\\"And he trusts Snape?\\\\\\\" Ron said. \\\\\\\"He really trusts Snape, even though he knows he was a Death Eater?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Yes,\\\\\\\" said Harry.  Hermione had not spoken for ten minutes. She was sitting with her forehead in her hands, staring at her knees. Harry thought she too looked as though she could have done with a Pensieve.  \\\\\\\"Rita Skeeter,\\\\\\\" she muttered finally.  \\\\\\\"How can you be worrying about her now?\\\\\\\" said Ron, in utter disbelief.  \\\\\\\"I'm not worrying about her,\\\\\\\" Hermione said to her knees. \\\\\\\"I'm just thinking. . .  remember what she said to me in the Three Broomsticks? 'I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl. ' This is what she meant, isn't it? She reported his trial, she knew he'd passed information to the Death Eaters. And Winky too, remember . .  .'Ludo Bagman's a bad wizard.' Mr. Crouch would have been furious he got off, he would have talked about it at home.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Yeah, but Bagman didn't pass information on purpose, did he?\\\\\\\"  Hermione shrugged.  \\\\\\\"And Fudge reckons Madame Maxime attacked Crouch?\\\\\\\" Ron said, turning back to Harry.  \\\\\\\"Yeah,\\\\\\\" said Harry, \\\\\\\"but he's only saying that because Crouch disappeared near the Beauxbatons carriage.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"We never thought of her, did we?\\\\\\\" said Ron slowly. \\\\\\\"Mind you, she's definitely got giant blood, and she doesn't want to admit it-\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Of course she doesn't,\\\\\\\" said Hermione sharply, looking up. \\\\\\\"Look what happened to Hagrid when Rita found out about his mother. Look at Fudge, jumping to conclusions about her, just because she's part giant. Who needs that sort of prejudice? I'd probably say I had big bones if I knew that's what I'd get for telling the truth.\\\\\\\"  Hermione looked at her watch. \\\\\\\"We haven't done any practicing!\\\\\\\" she said, looking shocked. \\\\\\\"We were going to do the Impediment Curse! We'll have to really get down to it tomorrow! Come on. Harry, you need to get some sleep.\\\\\\\"  Harry and Ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory. As Harry pulled on his pajamas, he looked over at Nevilles bed. True to his word to Dumbledore, he had not told Ron and Hermione about Neville s parents. As Harry took off his glasses and climbed into his four-poster, he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you. He often got sympathy from strangers for being an orphan, but as he listened to Nevilles snores, he thought that Neville deserved it more than he did. Lying in the darkness, Harry felt a rush of anger and hate toward the people who had tortured Mr. and Mrs. Longbottom. ... He remembered the jeers of the crowd as Crouch's son and his companions had been dragged from the court by the dementors. ... He understood how they had felt. . . . Then he remembered the milk-white face of the screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died a year later. . . .  It was Voldemort, Harry thought, staring up at the canopy of his bed in the darkness, it all came back to Voldemort. ... He was the one who had torn these families apart, who had ruined all these lives. . . .  Ron and Hermione were supposed to be studying for their exams, which would finish on the day of the third task, but they were putting most of their efforts into helping Harry prepare.  \\\\\\\"Don't worry about it,\\\\\\\" Hermione said shortly when Harry pointed this out to them and  said he didn't mind practicing on his own for a while, \\\\\\\"at least we'll get top marks in Defense Against the Dark Arts. We'd never have found out about all these hexes in class.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Good training for when we're all Aurors,\\\\\\\" said Ron excitedly, attempting the Impediment Curse on a wasp that had buzzed into the room and making it stop dead in midair.  The mood in the castle as they entered June became excited and tense again. Everyone was looking forward to the third task, which would take place a week before the end of term.  Harry was practicing hexes at every available moment. He felt more confident about this task than either of the others. Difficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly be, Moody was right: Harry had managed to find his way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers before now, and this time he had some notice, some chance to prepare himself for what lay ahead.  Tired of walking in on Harry, Hermione, and Ron all over the school. Professor McGonagall had given them permission to use the empty Transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes. Harry had soon mastered the Impediment Curse, a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers; the Reductor Curse, which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way; and the Four-Point Spell, a useful discovery of Hermiones that would make his wand point due north, therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the right direction within the maze. He was still having trouble with the Shield Charm, though.  This was supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses; Hermione managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs Jinx, and Harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the counter-jinx.  \\\\\\\"You're still doing really well, though,\\\\\\\" Hermione said encouragingly, looking down her list and crossing off those spells they had already learned. \\\\\\\"Some of these are bound to come in handy.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Come and look at this,\\\\\\\" said Ron, who was standing by the window. He was staring down onto the grounds. \\\\\\\"What's Malfoy doing?\\\\\\\"  Harry and Hermione went to see. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in the shadow of a tree below. Crabbe and Goyle seemed to be keeping a lookout; both were smirking.  Malfoy was holding his hand up to his mouth and speaking into it.  \\\\\\\"He looks like he's using a walkie-talkie,\\\\\\\" said Harry curiously.  \\\\\\\"He can't be,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, \\\\\\\"I've told you, those sorts of things don't work around Hogwarts. Come on, Harry,\\\\\\\" she added briskly, turning away from the window and moving back into the middle of the room, \\\\\\\"let's try that Shield Charm again.\\\\\\\"  Sirius was sending daily owls now. Like Hermione, he seemed to want to concentrate on getting Harry through the last task before they concerned themselves with anything else.  He reminded Harry in every letter that whatever might be going on outside the walls of Hogwarts was not Harry's responsibility, nor was it within his power to influence it.  If Voldemort is really getting stronger again, he wrote, my priority is to ensure your safety. He cannot hope to lay hands on you while you are under Dumbledore's protection, but all the same, take no risks: Concentrate on getting through that maze safely, and then we can turn our attention to other matters.  Harry's nerves mounted as June the twenty-fourth drew closer, but they were not as bad as those he had felt before the first and second tasks. For one thing, he was confident that, this time, he had done everything in his power to prepare for the task. For another, this was the final hurdle, and however well or badly he did, the tournament would at last be over, which would be an enormous relief.  Breakfast was a very noisy affair at the Gryffindor table on the morning of the third task. The post owls appeared, bringing Harry a good-luck card from Sirius. It was only a piece of parchment, folded over and bearing a muddy paw print on its front, but Harry appreciated it all the same. A screech owl arrived for Hermione, carrying her morning copy of the Daily Prophet as usual. She unfolded the paper, glanced at the front page, and spat out a mouthful of pumpkin juice all over it.  \\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\" said Harry and Ron together, staring at her. \\\\\\\"Nothing,\\\\\\\" said Hermione quickly, trying to shove the paper out of sight, but Ron grabbed it. He stared at the headline and said, \\\\\\\"No way. Not today. That old cow.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Rita Skeeter again?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Ron, and just like Hermione, he attempted to push the paper out of sight.  \\\\\\\"It's about me, isn't it?\\\\\\\" said Harry.  \\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Ron, in an entirely unconvincing tone. But before Harry could demand to see the paper. Draco Malfoy shouted across the Great Hall from the Slytherin table.  \\\\\\\"Hey, Potter! Potter! How's your head? You feeling all right? Sure you're not going to go berserk on us?\\\\\\\"  Malfoy was holding a copy of the Daily Prophet too. Slytherins up and down the table were sniggering, twisting in their seats to see Harry's reaction.  \\\\\\\"Let me see it,\\\\\\\" Harry said to Ron. \\\\\\\"Give it here.\\\\\\\"  Very reluctantly, Ron handed over the newspaper. Harry turned it over and found himself staring at his own picture, beneath the banner headline:  \\\\\\\"HARRY POTTER \\\\\\\"DISTURBED AND DANGEROUS\\\\\\\"  The boy who defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is unstable and possibly dangerous, writes Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. Alarming evidence has recently come to light about Harry Potter's strange behavior, which casts doubts upon his suitability to compete in a demanding competition like the Triwizard Tournament, or even to attend Hogwarts School.  Potter, the Daily Prophet can exclusively reveal, regularly collapses at school, and is often heard to complain of pain in the scar on his forehead (relic of the curse with which You-Know-Who attempted to kill him). On Monday last, midway through a Divination lesson, your Daily Prophet reporter witnessed Potter storming from the class, claiming that his scar was hurting too badly to continue studying.  It is possible, say top experts at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, that Potters brain was affected by the attack inflicted upon him by You-Know-Who, and that his insistence that the scar is still hurting is an expression of his deep-seated confusion.  \\\\\\\"He might even be pretending,\\\\\\\" said one specialist. \\\\\\\"This could be a plea for attention.\\\\\\\"  The Daily Prophet, however, has unearthed worrying facts about Harry Potter that Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, has carefully concealed from the wizarding public.  \\\\\\\"Potter can speak Parseltongue,\\\\\\\" reveals Draco Malfoy, a Hogwarts fourth year. \\\\\\\"There were a lot of attacks on students a couple of years ago, and most people thought Potter was behind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on another boy. It was all hushed up, though. But he's made friends with werewolves and giants too. We think he'd do anything for a bit of power.\\\\\\\"  Parseltongue, the ability to converse with snakes, has long been considered a Dark Art.  Indeed, the most famous Parselmouth of our times is none other than You-Know-Who himself.  A member of the Dark Force Defense League, who wished to remain unnamed, stated that he would regard any wizard who could speak Parseltongue \\\\\\\"as worthy of investigation.  Personally, I would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes, as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of Dark Magic, and are historically associated with evildoers.\\\\\\\" Similarly, \\\\\\\"anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for violence.\\\\\\\"  Albus Dumbledore should surely consider whether a boy such as this should be allowed to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. Some fear that Potter might resort to the Dark Arts in his desperation to win the tournament, the third task of which takes place this evening.  \\\\\\\"Gone off me a bit, hasn't she?\\\\\\\" said Harry lightly, folding up the paper.  Over at the Slytherin table, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were laughing at him, tapping their heads with their fingers, pulling grotesquely mad faces, and waggling their tongues like snakes.  \\\\\\\"How did she know your scar hurt in Divination?\\\\\\\" Ron said. \\\\\\\"There's no way she was there, there's no way she could've heard -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"The window was open,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"I opened it to breathe.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"You were at the top of North Tower!\\\\\\\" Hermione said. \\\\\\\"Your voice couldn't have carried all the way down to the grounds!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Well, you're the one who's supposed to be researching magical methods of bugging!\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"You tell me how she did it!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I've been trying!\\\\\\\" said Hermione. \\\\\\\"But I... but. . .\\\\\\\"  An odd, dreamy expression suddenly came over Hermione's face. She slowly raised a hand  and ran her fingers through her hair.  \\\\\\\"Are you all right?\\\\\\\" said Ron, frowning at her.  \\\\\\\"Yes,\\\\\\\" said Hermione breathlessly. She ran her fingers through her hair again, and then held her hand up to her mouth, as though speaking into an invisible walkie-talkie. Harry and Ron stared at each other.  \\\\\\\"I've had an idea,\\\\\\\" Hermione said, gazing into space. \\\\\\\"I think I know. . . because then no one would be able to see ... even Moody. . . and she'd have been able to get onto the window ledge . . . but she's not allowed . . . she's definitely not allowed ... I think we've got her! Just give me two seconds in the library - just to make sure!\\\\\\\"  With that, Hermione seized her school bag and dashed out of the Great Hall.  \\\\\\\"Oi!\\\\\\\" Ron called after her. \\\\\\\"We've got our History of Magic exam in ten minutes!  Blimey,\\\\\\\" he said, turning back to Harry, \\\\\\\"she must really hate that Skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam. What're you going to do in Binns's class - read again?\\\\\\\"  Exempt from the end-of-term tests as a Triwizard champion, Harry had been sitting in the back of every exam class so far, looking up fresh hexes for the third task.  \\\\\\\"S'pose so,\\\\\\\" Harry said to Ron; but just then. Professor McGonagall came walking alongside the Gryffindor table toward him.  \\\\\\\"Potter, the champions are congregating in the chamber off the Hall after breakfast,\\\\\\\" she said.  \\\\\\\"But the task's not till tonight!\\\\\\\" said Harry, accidentally spilling scrambled eggs down his front, afraid he had mistaken the time.  \\\\\\\"I'm aware of that, Potter,\\\\\\\" she said. \\\\\\\"The champions' families are invited to watch the final task, you know. This is simply a chance for you to greet them.\\\\\\\"  She moved away. Harry gaped after her.  \\\\\\\"She doesn't expect the Dursleys to turn up, does she?\\\\\\\" he asked Ron blankly.  \\\\\\\"Dunno,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"Harry, I'd better hurry, I'm going to be late for Binns. See you later.\\\\\\\"  Harry finished his breakfast in the emptying Great Hall. He saw Fleur Delacour get up from the Ravenclaw table and join Cedric as he crossed to the side chamber and entered.  Krum slouched off to join them shortly afterward. Harry stayed where he was. He really didn't want to go into the chamber. He had no family - no family who would turn up to see him risk his life, anyway. But just as he was getting up, thinking that he might as well go up to the library and do a spot more hex research, the door of the side chamber opened, and Cedric stuck his head out.  \\\\\\\"Harry, come on, they're waiting for you!\\\\\\\"  Utterly perplexed. Harry got up. The Dursleys couldn't possibly be here, could they? He walked across the Hall and opened the door into the chamber.  Cedric and his parents were just inside the door. Viktor Krum was over in a corner, conversing with his dark-haired mother and father in rapid Bulgarian. He had inherited his fathers hooked nose. On the other side of the room, Fleur was jabbering away in French to her mother. Fleur's little sister, Gabrielle, was holding her mother's hand.  She waved at Harry, who waved back, grinning. Then he saw Mrs. Weasley and Bill standing in front of the fireplace, beaming at him.  \\\\\\\"Surprise!\\\\\\\" Mrs. Weasley said excitedly as he smiled broadly and walked over to them.  \\\\\\\"Thought we'd come and watch you. Harry!\\\\\\\" She bent down and kissed him on the cheek.  \\\\\\\"You all right?\\\\\\\" said Bill, grinning at Harry and shaking his hand. \\\\\\\"Charlie wanted to come, but he couldn't get time off. He said you were incredible against the Horntail.\\\\\\\"  Fleur Delacour, Harry noticed, was eyeing Bill with great interest over her mother's shoulder. Harry could tell she had no objection whatsoever to long hair or earrings with fangs on them.  \\\\\\\"This is really nice of you,\\\\\\\" Harry muttered to Mrs. Weasley. \\\\\\\"I thought for a moment -the Dursleys -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Hmm,\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley, pursing her lips. She had always refrained from criticizing the Dursleys in front of Harry, but her eyes flashed every time they were mentioned.  \\\\\\\"It's great being back here,\\\\\\\" said Bill, looking around the chamber (Violet, the Fat Lady's friend, winked at him from her frame). \\\\\\\"Haven't seen this place for five years.  Is that picture of the mad knight still around? Sir Cadogan?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Oh yeah,\\\\\\\" said Harry, who had met Sir Cadogan the previous year.  \\\\\\\"And the Fat Lady?\\\\\\\" said Bill.  \\\\\\\"She was here in my time,\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley. \\\\\\\"She gave me such a telling off one night when I got back to the dormitory at four in the morning -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the morning?\\\\\\\" said Bill, surveying his mother with amazement.  Mrs. Weasley grinned, her eyes twinkling.  \\\\\\\"Your father and I had been for a nighttime stroll,\\\\\\\" she said. \\\\\\\"He got caught by Apollyon Pringle - he was the caretaker in those days - your father's still got the marks.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Fancy giving us a tour, Harry?\\\\\\\" said Bill.  \\\\\\\"Yeah, okay,\\\\\\\" said Harry, and they made their way back toward the door into the Great Hall. As they passed Amos Diggory, he looked around.  \\\\\\\"There you are, are you?\\\\\\\" he said, looking Harry up and down.  \\\\\\\"Bet you're not feeling quite as full of yourself now Cedrics caught you up on points, are you?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\" said Harry.  \\\\\\\"Ignore him,\\\\\\\" said Cedric in a low voice to Harry, frowning after his father. \\\\\\\"He's been angry ever since Rita Skeeters article about the Triwizard Tournament - you know, when she made out you were the only Hogwarts champion.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Didn't bother to correct her, though, did he?\\\\\\\" said Amos Diggory, loudly enough for Harry to hear as he started to walk out of the door with Mrs. Weasley and Bill. \\\\\\\"Still, . . you'll show him, Ced. Beaten him once before, haven't you?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Rita Skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble, Amos!\\\\\\\" Mrs. Weasley said angrily. \\\\\\\"I would have thought you'd know that, working at the Ministry!\\\\\\\"  Mr. Diggory looked as though he was going to say something angry, but his wife laid a hand on his arm, and he merely shrugged and turned away.  Harry had a very enjoyable morning walking over the sunny grounds with Bill and Mrs.  Weasley, showing them the Beauxbatons carriage and the Durmstrang ship. Mrs. Weasley was intrigued by the Whomping Willow, which had been planted after she had left school, and reminisced at length about the gamekeeper before Hagrid, a man called Ogg.  \\\\\\\"How's Percy?\\\\\\\" Harry asked as they walked around the greenhouses.  \\\\\\\"Not good,\\\\\\\" said Bill.  \\\\\\\"He's very upset,\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley, lowering her voice and glancing around. \\\\\\\"The Ministry wants to keep Mr. Crouch's disappearance quiet, but Percy's been hauled in for questioning about the instructions Mr. Crouch has been sending in. They seem to think there's a chance they weren't genuinely written by him. Percy's been under a lot of strain. They're not letting him fill in for Mr. Crouch as the fifth judge tonight.  Cornelius Fudge is going to be doing it.\\\\\\\"  They returned to the castle for lunch.  \\\\\\\"Mum - Bill!\\\\\\\" said Ron, looking stunned, as he joined the Gryffindor table. \\\\\\\"What're you doing here?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Come to watch Harry in the last task!\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley brightly. \\\\\\\"I must say, it makes a lovely change, not having to cook. How was your exam?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Oh . . . okay,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"Couldn't remember all the goblin rebels' names, so I invented a few. It's all right,\\\\\\\" he said, helping himself to a Cornish pasty, while Mrs. Weasley looked stern, \\\\\\\"they're all called stuff like Bodrod the Bearded and Urg the Unclean; it wasn't hard.\\\\\\\"  Fred, George, and Ginny came to sit next to them too, and Harry was having such a good time he felt almost as though he were back at the Burrow; he had forgotten to worry about that evening's task, and not until Hermione turned up, halfway through lunch, did he remember that she had had a brainwave about Rita Skeeter.  \\\\\\\"Are you going to tell us - ?\\\\\\\"  Hermione shook her head warningly and glanced at Mrs. Weasley.  \\\\\\\"Hello, Hermione,\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley, much more stiffly than usual.  \\\\\\\"Hello,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, her smile faltering at the cold expression on Mrs. Weasley's face.  Harry looked between them, then said, \\\\\\\"Mrs. Weasley, you didn't believe that rubbish Rita Skeeter wrote in Witch Weekly, did you? Because Hermione's not my girlfriend.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Oh!\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley \\\\\\\"No - of course I didn't!\\\\\\\"  But she became considerably warmer toward Hermione after that.  Harry, Bill, and Mrs. Weasley whiled away the afternoon with a long walk around the castle, and then returned to the Great Hall for the evening feast. Ludo Bagman and Cornelius Fudge had joined the staff table now. Bagman looked quite cheerful, but Cornelius Fudge, who was sitting next to Madame Maxime, looked stern and was not talking.  Madame Maxime was concentrating on her plate, and Harry thought her eyes looked red.  Hagrid kept glancing along the table at her, There were more courses than usual, but Harry, who was starting to feel really nervous now, didn't eat much. As the enchanted ceiling overhead began to fade from blue to a dusky purple, Dumbledore rose to his feet at the staff table, and silence fell.  \\\\\\\"Ladies and gentlemen, in five minutes' time, I will be asking you to make your way down to the Quidditch field for the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament. Will the champions please follow Mr. Bagman down to the stadium now.\\\\\\\"  Harry got up. The Gryffindors all along the table were applauding him; the Weasleys and Hermione all wished him good luck, and he headed off out of the Great Hall with Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor.  \\\\\\\"Feeling all right. Harry?\\\\\\\" Bagman asked as they went down the stone steps onto the grounds. \\\\\\\"Confident?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I'm okay,\\\\\\\" said Harry. It was sort of true; he was nervous, but he kept running over all the hexes and spells he had been practicing in his mind as they walked, and the knowledge that he could remember them all made him feel better.  They walked onto the Quidditch field, which was now completely unrecognizable. A twenty-foot-high hedge ran all the way around the edge of it. There was a gap right in front of them: the entrance to the vast maze. The passage beyond it looked dark and creepy.  Five minutes later, the stands had begun to fill; the air was full of excited voices and the rumbling of feet as the hundreds of students filed into their seats. The sky was a deep, clear blue now, and the first stars were starting to appear. Hagrid, Professor Moody, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Flitwick came walking into the stadium and approached Bagman and the champions. They were wearing large, red, luminous stars on their hats, all except Hagrid, who had his on the back of his moleskin vest.  \\\\\\\"We are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze,\\\\\\\" said Professor McGonagall to the champions. \\\\\\\"If you get into difficulty, and wish to be rescued, send red sparks into the air, and one of us will come and get you, do you understand?\\\\\\\"  The champions nodded.  \\\\\\\"Off you go, then!\\\\\\\" said Bagman brightly to the four patrollers.  \\\\\\\"Good luck. Harry,\\\\\\\" Hagrid whispered, and the four of them walked away in different directions, to station themselves around the maze. Bagman now pointed his wand at his throat, muttered, \\\\\\\"Sonorus,\\\\\\\" and his magically magnified voice echoed into the stands.  \\\\\\\"Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament is about to begin! Let me remind you how the points currently stand! Tied in first place, with eighty-five points each - Mr. Cedric Diggory and Mr. Harry Potter, both of Hogwarts School!\\\\\\\" The cheers and applause sent birds from the Forbidden Forest fluttering into the darkening sky. \\\\\\\"In second place, with eighty points - Mr. Viktor Krum, of Durmstrang Institute!\\\\\\\" More applause. \\\\\\\"And in third place - Miss Fleur Delacour, of Beauxbatons Academy!\\\\\\\"  Harry could just make out Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione applauding Fleur politely, halfway up the stands. He waved up at them, and they waved back, beaming at him.  \\\\\\\"So ... on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!\\\\\\\" said Bagman. \\\\\\\"Three - two - one -\\\\\\\"  He gave a short blast on his whistle, and Harry and Cedric hurried forward into the maze.  The towering hedges cast black shadows across the path, and, whether because they were so tall and thick or because they had been enchanted, the sound of the surrounding crowd was silenced the moment they entered the maze. Harry felt almost as though he were underwater again. He pulled out his wand, muttered, \\\\\\\"Lumos,\\\\\\\" and heard Cedric do the same just behind him.  After about fifty yards, they reached a fork. They looked at each other.  \\\\\\\"See you,\\\\\\\" Harry said, and he took the left one, while Cedric took the right.  Harry heard Bagman's whistle for the second time. Krum had entered the maze. Harry sped up. His chosen path seemed completely deserted. He turned right, and hurried on, holding his wand high over his head, trying to see as far ahead as possible. Still, there was nothing in sight.  Bagman's whistle blew in the distance for the third time. All of the champions were now inside.  Harry kept looking behind him. The old feeling that he was being watched was upon him.  The maze was growing darker with every passing minute as the sky overhead deepened to  navy. He reached a second fork.  \\\\\\\"Point Me,\\\\\\\" he whispered to his wand, holding it flat in his palm.  The wand spun around once and pointed toward his right, into solid hedge. That way was north, and he knew that he needed to go northwest for the center of the maze. The best he could do was to take the left fork and go right again as soon as possible.  The path ahead was empty too, and when Harry reached a right turn and took it, he again found his way unblocked. Harry didn't know why, but the lack of obstacles was unnerving him. Surely he should have met something by now? It felt as though the maze were luring him into a false sense of security. Then he heard movement right behind him. He held out his wand, ready to attack, but its beam fell only upon Cedric, who had just hurried out of a path on the right-hand side. Cedric looked severely shaken. The sleeve of his robe was smoking.  \\\\\\\"Hagrid's Blast-Ended Skrewts!\\\\\\\" he hissed. \\\\\\\"They're enormous - I only just got away!\\\\\\\"  He shook his head and dived out of sight, along another path. Keen to put plenty of distance between himself and the skrewts, Harry hurried off again. Then, as he turned a corner, he saw ... a dementor gliding toward him. Twelve feet tall, its face hidden by its hood, its rotting, scabbed hands outstretched, it advanced, sensing its way blindly toward him. Harry could hear its rattling breath; he felt clammy coldness stealing over him, but knew what he had to do....  He summoned the happiest thought he could, concentrated with all his might on the thought of getting out of the maze and celebrating with Ron and Hermione, raised his wand, and cried, \\\\\\\"Expecto Patronum!\\\\\\\"  A silver stag erupted from the end of Harry's wand and galloped toward the dementor, which fell back and tripped over the hem of its robes. . . . Harry had never seen a dementor stumble.  \\\\\\\"Hang on!\\\\\\\" he shouted, advancing in the wake of his silver Patronus, \\\\\\\"You're a boggart!  Riddikulus!\\\\\\\"  There was a loud crack, and the shape-shifter exploded in a wisp of smoke. The silver stag faded from sight. Harry wished it could have stayed, he could have used some company...but he moved on, quickly and quietly as possible, listening hard, his wand held high once more.  Left ... right... left again . . . Twice he found himself facing dead ends. He did the Four-Point Spell again and found that he was going too far east. He turned back, took a right turn, and saw an odd golden mist floating ahead of him.  Harry approached it cautiously, pointing the wand's beam at it. This looked like some kind of enchantment. He wondered whether he might be able to blast it out of the way.  \\\\\\\"Reducio!\\\\\\\" he said.  The spell shot straight through the mist, leaving it intact. He supposed he should have known better; the Reductor Curse was for solid objects. What would happen if he walked through the mist? Was it worth chancing it, or should he double back?  He was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silence.  \\\\\\\"Fleur?\\\\\\\" Harry yelled.  There was silence. He stared all around him. What had happened to her? Her scream seemed to have come from somewhere ahead. He took a deep breath and ran through the enchanted mist.  The world turned upside down. Harry was hanging from the ground, with his hair on end, his glasses dangling off his nose, threatening to fall into the bottomless sky. He clutched them to the end of his nose and hung there, terrified. It felt as though his feet were glued to the grass, which had now become the ceiling. Below him the dark, star-spangled heavens stretched endlessly. He felt as though if he tried to move one of his feet, he would fall away from the earth completely.  Think, he told himself, as all the blood rushed to his head, think. . .  But not one of the spells he had practiced had been designed to combat a sudden reversal of ground and sky. Did he dare move his foot? He could hear the blood pounding in his ears. He had two choices - try and move, or send up red sparks, and get rescued and disqualified from the task.  He shut his eyes, so he wouldn't be able to see the view of endless space below him, and pulled his right foot as hard as he could away from the grassy ceiling.  Immediately, the world righted itself. Harry fell forward onto his knees onto the wonderfully solid ground. He felt temporarily limp with shock. He took a deep, steadying breath, then got up again and hurried forward, looking back over his shoulder as he ran  away from the golden mist, which twinkled innocently at him in the moonlight.  He paused at a junction of two paths and looked around for some sign of Fleur. He was sure it had been she who had screamed. What had she met? Was she all right? There was no sign of red sparks - did that mean she had got herself out of trouble, or was she in such trouble that she couldn't reach her wand? Harry took the right fork with a feeling of increasing unease . . . but at the same time, he couldn't help thinking. One champion down. . .  The cup was somewhere close by, and it sounded as though Fleur was no longer in the running. He'd got this far, hadn't he? What if he actually managed to win? Fleetingly, and for the first time since he'd found himself champion, he saw again that image of himself, raising the Triwizard Cup in front of the rest of the school. . . .  He met nothing for ten minutes, but kept running into dead ends. Twice he took the same wrong turning. Finally, he found a new route and started to jog along it, his wandlight waving, making his shadow flicker and distort on the hedge walls. Then he rounded another corner and found himself facing a Blast-Ended Skrewt.  Cedric was right - it was enormous. Ten feet long, it looked more like a giant scorpion than anything. Its long sting was curled over its back. Its thick armor glinted in the light from Harry's wand, which he pointed at it.  \\\\\\\"Stupefy!\\\\\\\"  The spell hit the skrewt's armor and rebounded; Harry ducked just in time, but could smell burning hair; it had singed the top of his head. The skrewt issued a blast of fire from its end and flew forward toward him.  \\\\\\\"Impedimenta!\\\\\\\" Harry yelled. The spell hit the skrewt's armor again and ricocheted off; Harry staggered back a few paces and fell over. \\\\\\\"IMPEDIMENTA!\\\\\\\"  The skrewt was inches from him when it froze - he had managed to hit it on its fleshy, shell-less underside. Panting, Harry pushed himself away from it and ran, hard, in the opposite direction - the Impediment Curse was not permanent; the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment.  He took a left path and hit a dead end, a right, and hit another; forcing himself to stop, heart hammering, he performed the Four-Point Spell again, backtracked, and chose a path that would take him northwest.  He had been hurrying along the new path for a few minutes, when he heard something in the path running parallel to his own that made him stop dead.  \\\\\\\"What are you doing?\\\\\\\" yelled Cedric's voice. \\\\\\\"What the hell d'you think you're doing?\\\\\\\"  And then Harry heard Krum's voice.  \\\\\\\"Crucio!\\\\\\\"  The air was suddenly full of Cedric's yells. Horrified, Harry began sprinting up his path, trying to find a way into Cedric's. When none appeared, he tried the Reductor Curse again. It wasn't very effective, but it burned a small hole in the hedge through which Harry forced his leg, kicking at the thick brambles and branches until they broke and made an opening; he struggled through it, tearing his robes, and looking to his right, saw Cedric jerking and twitching on the ground, Krum standing over him.  Harry pulled himself up and pointed his wand at Krum just as Krum looked up. Krum turned and began to run.  \\\\\\\"Stupefy!\\\\\\\" Harry yelled.  The spell hit Krum in the back; he stopped dead in his tracks, fell forward, and lay motionless, facedown in the grass. Harry-dashed over to Cedric, who had stopped twitching and was lying there panting, his hands over his face.  \\\\\\\"Are you all right?\\\\\\\" Harry said roughly, grabbing Cedric's arm.  \\\\\\\"Yeah,\\\\\\\" panted Cedric. \\\\\\\"Yeah ... I don't believe it... he crept up behind me. ... I heard him, I turned around, and he had his wand on me. . . .\\\\\\\"  Cedric got up. He was still shaking. He and Harry looked down at Krum.  \\\\\\\"I can't believe this ... I thought he was all right,\\\\\\\" Harry said, staring at Krum.  \\\\\\\"So did I,\\\\\\\" said Cedric.  \\\\\\\"Did you hear Fleur scream earlier?\\\\\\\" said Harry.  \\\\\\\"Yeah,\\\\\\\" said Cedric. \\\\\\\"You don't think Krum got her too?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I don't know,\\\\\\\" said Harry slowly.  \\\\\\\"Should we leave him here?\\\\\\\" Cedric muttered.  \\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"I reckon we should send up red sparks. Someone'll come and collect him . . . otherwise he'll probably be eaten by a skrewt.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"He'd deserve it,\\\\\\\" Cedric muttered, but all the same, he raised his wand and shot a  shower of red sparks into the air, which hovered high above Krum, marking the spot where he lay.  Harry and Cedric stood there in the darkness for a moment, looking around them. Then Cedric said, \\\\\\\"Well... I s'pose we'd better go on. . . .\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Oh . . . yeah . . . right. . .\\\\\\\"  It was an odd moment. He and Cedric had been briefly united against Krum - now the fact that they were opponents came back to Harry. The two of them proceeded up the dark path without speaking, then Harry turned left, and Cedric right. Cedric's footsteps soon died away.  Harry moved on, continuing to use the Four-Point Spell, making sure he was moving in the right direction. It was between him and Cedric now. His desire to reach the cup first was now burning stronger than ever, but he could hardly believe what he'd just seen Krum do. The use of an Unforgivable Curse on a fellow human being meant a life term in Azkaban, that was what Moody had told them. Krum surely couldn't have wanted the Triwizard Cup that badly....Harry sped up.  Every so often he hit more dead ends, but the increasing darkness made him feel sure he was getting near the heart of the maze. Then, as he strode down a long, straight path, he saw movement once again, and his beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary creature, one which he had only seen in picture form, in his Monster Book of Monsters.  It was a sphinx. It had the body of an over-large lion: great clawed paws and a long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft. Its head, however, was that of a woman. She turned her long, almond-shaped eyes upon Harry as he approached. He raised his wand, hesitating. She was not crouching as if to spring, but pacing from side to side of the path, blocking his progress. Then she spoke, in a deep, hoarse voice.  \\\\\\\"You are very near your goal. The quickest way is past me.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"So ... so will you move, please?\\\\\\\" said Harry, knowing what the answer was going to be.  \\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" she said, continuing to pace. \\\\\\\"Not unless you can answer my riddle. Answer on your first guess - I let you pass. Answer wrongly - I attack. Remain silent - I will let you walk away from me unscathed.\\\\\\\"  Harry's stomach slipped several notches. It was Hermione who was good at this sort of thing, not him. He weighed his chances. If the riddle was too hard, he could keep silent, get away from the sphinx unharmed, and try and find an alternative route to the center.  \\\\\\\"Okay,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"Can I hear the riddle?\\\\\\\"  The sphinx sat down upon her hind legs, in the very middle of the path, and recited:  \\\\\\\"First think of the person who lives in disguise, Who deals in secrets and tells naught but lies.  Next, tell me what's always the last thing to mend, The middle of middle and end of the end?  And finally give me the sound often heard During the search for a hard-to-find word.  Now string them together, and answer me this, Which creature would you be unwilling to kiss?\\\\\\\"  Harry gaped at her.  \\\\\\\"Could I have it again . . . more slowly?\\\\\\\" he asked tentatively. She blinked at him, smiled, and repeated the poem. \\\\\\\"All the clues add up to a creature I wouldn't want to kiss?\\\\\\\" Harry asked.  She merely smiled her mysterious smile. Harry took that for a \\\\\\\"yes.\\\\\\\" Harry cast his mind around. There were plenty of animals he wouldn't want to kiss; his immediate thought was a Blast-Ended Skrewt, but something told him that wasn't the answer. He'd have to try and work out the clues. . . .  \\\\\\\"A person in disguise,\\\\\\\" Harry muttered, staring at her, \\\\\\\"who lies ... er ... that'd be a - an impostor. No, that's not my guess! A - a spy? I'll come back to that. . . could you give me the next clue again, please?\\\\\\\"  She repeated the next lines of the poem.  \\\\\\\"'The last thing to mend,'\\\\\\\" Harry repeated. \\\\\\\"Er ... no idea . . . 'middle of middle' . .  . could I have the last bit again?\\\\\\\"  She gave him the last four lines.  \\\\\\\"'The sound often heard during the search for a hard-to-find word,'\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Er . .  . that'd be ... er ... hang on - 'er'! Er's a sound!\\\\\\\"  The sphinx smiled at him.  \\\\\\\"Spy ... er ... spy ... er ...\\\\\\\" said Harry, pacing up and down. \\\\\\\"A creature I wouldn't want to kiss . . . a spider!\\\\\\\"  The sphinx smiled more broadly. She got up, stretched her front legs, and then moved aside for him to pass.  \\\\\\\"Thanks!\\\\\\\" said Harry, and, amazed at his own brilliance, he dashed forward.  He had to be close now, he had to be. ... His wand was telling him he was bang on course; as long as he didn't meet anything too horrible, he might have a chance. . . .  Harry broke into a run. He had a choice of paths up ahead. \\\\\\\"Point Me!\\\\\\\" he whispered again to his wand, and it spun around and pointed him to the right-hand one. He dashed up this one and saw light ahead.  The Triwizard Cup was gleaming on a plinth a hundred yards away. Suddenly a dark figure hurtled out onto the path in front of him.  Cedric was going to get there first. Cedric was sprinting as fast as he could toward the cup, and Harry knew he would never catch up, Cedric was much taller, had much longer legs -Then Harry saw something immense over a hedge to his left, moving quickly along a path that intersected with his own; it was moving so fast Cedric was about to run into it, and Cedric, his eyes on the cup, had not seen it -\\\\\\\"  Cedric!\\\\\\\" Harry bellowed. \\\\\\\"On your left!\\\\\\\"  Cedric looked around just in time to hurl himself past the thing and avoid colliding with it, but in his haste, he tripped. Harry saw Cedric's wand fly out of his hand as a gigantic spider stepped into the path and began to bear down upon Cedric.  \\\\\\\"Stupefy!\\\\\\\" Harry yelled; the spell hit the spider's gigantic, hairy black body, but for all the good it did, he might as well have thrown a stone at it; the spider jerked, scuttled around, and ran at Harry instead.  \\\\\\\"Stupefy! Impedimenta! Stupefy!\\\\\\\"  But it was no use - the spider was either so large, or so magical, that the spells were doing no more than aggravating it. Harry had one horrifying glimpse of eight shining black eyes and razor-sharp pincers before it was upon him.  He was lifted into the air in its front legs; struggling madly, he tried to kick it; his leg connected with the pincers and next moment he was in excruciating pain. He could hear Cedric yelling \\\\\\\"Stupefy!\\\\\\\" too, but his spell had no more effect than Harry's - Harry raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers once more and shouted \\\\\\\"Expelliarmus!\\\\\\\"  It worked - the Disarming Spell made the spider drop him, but that meant that Harry fell twelve feet onto his already injured leg, which crumpled beneath him. Without pausing to think, he aimed high at the spider's underbelly, as he had done with the skrewt, and shouted \\\\\\\"Stupefy!''just as Cedric yelled the same thing.  The two spells combined did what one alone had not: The spider keeled over sideways, flattening a nearby hedge, and strewing the path with a tangle of hairy legs.  \\\\\\\"Harry!\\\\\\\" he heard Cedric shouting. \\\\\\\"You all right? Did it fall on you?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" Harry called back, panting. He looked down at his leg. It was bleeding freely. He could see some sort of thick, gluey secretion from the spider's pincers on his torn robes. He tried to get up, but his leg was shaking badly and did not want to support his weight. He leaned against the hedge, gasping for breath, and looked around.  Cedric was standing feet from the Triwizard Cup, which was gleaming behind him.  \\\\\\\"Take it, then,\\\\\\\" Harry panted to Cedric. \\\\\\\"Go on, take it. You're there.\\\\\\\"  But Cedric didn't move. He merely stood there, looking at Harry. Then he turned to stare at the cup. Harry saw the longing expression on his face in its golden light.  Cedric looked around at Harry again, who was now holding onto the hedge to support himself. Cedric took a deep breath.  \\\\\\\"You take it. You should win. That's twice you've saved my neck in here.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"That's not how it's supposed to work,\\\\\\\" Harry said. He felt angry; his leg was very painful, he was aching all over from trying to throw off the spider, and after all his efforts, Cedric had beaten him to it, just as he'd beaten Harry to ask Cho to the ball.  \\\\\\\"The one who reaches the cup first gets the points. That's you. I'm telling you, I'm not going to win any races on this leg.\\\\\\\"  Cedric took a few paces nearer to the Stunned spider, away from the cup, shaking his head.  \\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" he said.  \\\\\\\"Stop being noble,\\\\\\\" said Harry irritably. \\\\\\\"Just take it, then we can get out of here.\\\\\\\"  Cedric watched Harry steadying himself, holding tight to the hedge.  \\\\\\\"You told me about the dragons,\\\\\\\" Cedric said. \\\\\\\"I would've gone down in the first task if you hadn't told me what was coming.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I had help on that too,\\\\\\\" Harry snapped, trying to mop up his bloody leg with his robes.  \\\\\\\"You helped me with the egg - we're square.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I had help on the egg in the first place,\\\\\\\" said Cedric.  \\\\\\\"We're still square,\\\\\\\" said Harry, testing his leg gingerly; it shook violently as he put weight on it; he had sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped him.  \\\\\\\"You should've got more points on the second task,\\\\\\\" said Cedric mulishly. \\\\\\\"You stayed behind to get all the hostages. I should've done that.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously!\\\\\\\" said Harry bitterly. \\\\\\\"Just take the cup!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Cedric.  He stepped over the spider's tangled legs to join Harry, who stared at him. Cedric was serious. He was walking away from the sort of glory Hufflepuff House hadn't had in centuries.  \\\\\\\"Go on,\\\\\\\" Cedric said. He looked as though this was costing him every ounce of resolution he had, but his face was set, his arms were folded, he seemed decided.  Harry looked from Cedric to the cup. For one shining moment, he saw himself emerging from the maze, holding it. He saw himself holding the Triwizard Cup aloft, heard the roar of the crowd, saw Cho's face shining with admiration, more clearly than he had ever seen it before . . . and then the picture faded, and he found himself staring at Cedric's shadowy, stubborn face.  \\\\\\\"Both of us,\\\\\\\" Harry said.  \\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"We'll take it at the same time. It's still a Hogwarts victory. We'll tie for it.\\\\\\\"  Cedric stared at Harry. He unfolded his arms.  \\\\\\\"You - you sure?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Yeah,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Yeah . . . we've helped each other out, haven't we? We both got here. Let's just take it together.\\\\\\\"  For a moment, Cedric looked as though he couldn't believe his ears; then his face split in a grin.  \\\\\\\"You're on,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"Come here.\\\\\\\"  He grabbed Harrys arm below the shoulder and helped Harry limp toward the plinth where the cup stood. When they had reached it, they both held a hand out over one of the cup's gleaming handles.  \\\\\\\"On three, right?\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"One - two - three -\\\\\\\"  He and Cedric both grasped a handle.  Instantly, Harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his navel. His feet had left the ground.  He could not unclench the hand holding the Triwizard Cup; it was pulling him onward in a howl of wind and swirling color, Cedric at his side.\\u00a0\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Chapter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 10,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 38,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 38,\n        \"samples\": [\n          34,\n          37,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Book\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4,\n          6,\n          7\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
